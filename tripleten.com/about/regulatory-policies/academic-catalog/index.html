<h2 id="institutional-mission-and-objectives"><strong>Institutional Mission and Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>Our mission is to create and develop leading bootcamp programs worldwide for switching careers to tech. We help our students change their lives and build careers with programs that enable beginners from all backgrounds to be successful. We adapt our curriculums to how our students learn, so they can feel fully-supported when making their big leaps.</p>
<p>Our objectives are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on employment from day one. Getting a job is the entire point of attending a TripleTen bootcamp. We focus on career and job search readiness, enabling our students to present themselves as tech professionals upon completion of our programs.</li>
<li>Provide more support to drive better outcomes. We deliver personalized support. Every student receives the guidance, tutoring, and career coaching needed to reach their goals.</li>
<li>Meet our students where they are. We don’t ask our students to put their lives on hold, offering programs that take 20 hours instead of 60+. We also offer flexible terms and timing to make our bootcamps work with our students’ lives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructional-location"><strong>Instructional Location</strong></h2>
<p>Instruction is provided online through asynchronous instruction. Students can log in via <a href="https://id.tripleten.com/realms/public/protocol/openid-connect/auth?access_type=online&amp;client_id=tripleten-wirth&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftripleten.com%2Fsso%2Foauth%2Fcallback&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=email+profile+openid&amp;state=cfab950d-f8e0-4120-b104-8ea763c559c8">https://tripleten.com/sso/auth</a>.

<h2 id="language-of-instruction--required-proficiency"><strong>Language of Instruction &amp; Required Proficiency</strong></h2>
<p>All programs are taught in English. Students must be proficient in spoken and written English. English proficiency will be determined based on a third-party assessment and may be requested as a result of interactions with TripleTen student experience or Career Acceleration team. We define English proficiency as B2 level based on Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).</p>
<h2 id="accreditation-status-academic-credit--federal-or-state-financial-aid"><strong>Accreditation Status, Academic Credit, &amp; Federal or State Financial Aid</strong></h2>
<p>This institution is not accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education.&nbsp;This institution does not participate in any federal or state financial aid programs, and a student enrolled in an unaccredited institution is not eligible for federal financial aid. TripleTen does not confer formal degrees; a Certificate is not a formal degree. Further, you will not receive academic credit for your completion of a program; certificate will not entitle you to academic credit recognized by any other institution.</p>
<h2 id="student-conduct"><strong>Student Conduct</strong></h2>
<p>We value the integrity of TripleTen community. The TripleTen administration sets standards at its discretion to protect the community. Students agree to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tripleten.com/legal/code_of_conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. In addition, students agree not to use the TripleTen Service to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violate any local, state, national or international law or regulation;</li>

</ul>
<p>Students also agree not to use or launch any automated system, including, without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers” or the like, that access the TripleTen Service.</p>
<p>Students who have violated the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tripleten.com/legal/code_of_conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> or the above mentioned agreements my be suspended from the Program and/or you may receive a warning from TripleTen describing the nature of a given concern according to the provisions of the <a href="https://docs.tripleten.com/legal/terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h2 id="nondiscrimination-policy"><strong>Nondiscrimination Policy</strong></h2>
<p>This institution is committed to providing equal opportunities to all applicants to programs and to all applicants for employment. Therefore, no discrimination shall occur in any program or activity of this institution, including activities related to the solicitation of students or employees on the basis of race, color, religion, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, age, disability, veteran’s status, or any other classification that precludes a person from consideration as an individual.</p>
<h2 id="academic-freedom--integrity"><strong>Academic Freedom &amp; Integrity</strong></h2>
<p>TripleTen is committed to assuring full academic freedom to all faculty and students.&nbsp;TripleTen encourages coaches, tutors, and students to engage in discussion and dialog. Students and faculty members alike are encouraged to freely express views, however controversial, as long as they believe it would advance understanding in their specialized discipline or sub-disciplines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, academic integrity is valued at this institution. Students must ensure that all work performed and submitted (e.g., homework assignments, quizzes, exams, and projects) is entirely their own. Students will not share their work with anyone else or perform work for others, except when students are explicitly permitted to share or work with others. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students must not engage in any dishonest or improper conduct to improve their results or affect the results of other students.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-harassment"><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong></h2>
<p>This institution is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination, intimidation, and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, TripleTen believes that it is necessary to affirmatively confront this subject and express strong disapproval of sexual harassment. No one associated with this institution may engage in verbal abuse of a sexual nature; use sexually degrading or graphic words to describe an individual or an individual’s body; or display sexually suggestive objects or pictures within the TripleTen service or other locations associated with this institution. Students are responsible for conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of this policy.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation--grading-policy"><strong>Evaluation &amp; Grading Policy</strong></h2>
<p>TripleTen uses a pass/fail grading system. Evaluation of student achievement will be based on meeting the objectives for each program.  Students must achieve a “pass” rating on all projects in the program to achieve completion.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy--all-programs"><strong>Attendance Policy – All Programs</strong></h2>
<p>This institution’s policy on attendance tracking for all Programs, except for Software Engineer Program (Full-time Format), in an asynchronous setting is based on the premise that regular interaction with the content by the student, as well as regular and substantive interaction with coaches, tutors, and fellow students, has significant value in the learning process.</p>
<p>The student must demonstrate regular and substantive interaction, defined as demonstrating engagement with the materials for approximately 20 hours per week, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting to the program discussion board substantive comments relevant to the subject;</li>
<li>Applied effort on the sprint content, concepts, practice materials, and project;</li>
<li>Submission of sprint projects including revisions based on reviewer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>The student enrolled in Software Engineer Program (Full-time Format), which is based on a synchronous learning model, must maintain regular and substantive interaction by engaging with the program materials for approximately 40 hours per week.</p>
<p>Each program is comprised of modules of instruction, and each module contains “sprints” – 1, 2 or 3-week long topics of instruction consisting of theory, practice, and final sprint project. Each sprint is unlocked according to the predefined schedule of the program as well as student progress.&nbsp;Students will have access to the next sprint’s theory and practice material as soon as they have submitted their project for the preceding sprint, however students will not be able to begin work on that sprint’s project until the previously submitted project has been accepted with passing marks.</p>
<p>If students have not submitted their project for the sprint by the time that sprint is scheduled to complete, a student can take advantage of an extension, which students can use to prolong the sprint length if they need more time.</p>
<p>Each program has a limited number of such extension weeks, and this number varies based on the program length and difficulty.</p>
<p>Students may request up to 3 hours of individualized tutoring per week. Requests for 1-on-1 tutoring beyond 3 hours in a week may be denied. If a student does not cancel their scheduled tutoring at least 24 hours in advance, the session will be counted toward their weekly cap. Group events and meetings with individual Learning Coaches do not count towards this cap.</p>
<h2 id="academic-probation-and-dismissal-policies"><strong>Academic Probation and Dismissal Policies</strong></h2>
<p>TripleTen may suspend a student’s participation in the programs under one or more of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(a) if a student fails to pay their tuition fees or TripleTen is unable to process the payment;</p>
<p>(b) if a student breaches TripleTen Terms of Use or violates any policy in this catalog and/or the Code of Conduct;</p>
<p>(c) if a student fails to meet the program deadlines for submitting projects.</p>
<p>Continued failure to achieve satisfactory academic progress may result in dismissal from the program. The suspension will last until complete elimination of the reason or circumstances causing such suspension. If the student failed to fix the circumstances leading to its suspension within three business days following TripleTen’s notice of suspension, TripleTen may permanently terminate the student’s access to the program.</p>
<p>If the student wishes to appeal their suspension, the student is to submit a written request for an administrative academic review to the school administration:</p>
<p>TripleTen Inc.</p>
<p>1603 Capitol Ave, Suite #512A,Cheyenne, WY 82001</p>
<p>Email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:complaint@tripleten.com">complaints@tripleten.com</a></p>
<p>Violations of the Harassment or Discrimination Policy of this institution will become part of the student’s record. Depending on the severity and/or frequency of the violation(s), the institution may take disciplinary action, including administrative withdrawal from the institution.</p>
<h2 id="leaves-of-absence"><strong>Leaves of Absence</strong></h2>
<p>You may also request an extension of your studies. In this case, please be aware of the responsibility to meet all Program deadlines and complete the Program on time. To maintain eligibility for the Money-Back Guarantee, you must finish your studies within 1.5 times the standard enrollment period specified above. In case of your failure to return to the studies following three months of break, the access to the program may be canceled, and your return to the studies will require new enrollment into the program. Regardless of the reason for your extension, you will continue to be charged during the time of your extension until the cost of the program is fully paid. It does not affect your enrollment period for the purposes of refund calculation. To request an extension, please contact your Learning Coach.</p>
<h2 id="student-grievance-procedures"><strong>Student Grievance Procedures</strong></h2>
<p>Most problems or complaints that students may have with the institution or its administrators can be resolved through a personal meeting with the student’s Learning Coach. If, however, this action does not resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the student, he/she may submit a written complaint.</p>
<p>To initiate a complaint, please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose a written complaint outlining the specific nature of the issue you encountered.</li>
<li>Provide a detailed description of the problem, including any relevant circumstances.</li>

<p>The student can expect to receive a written response within ten business days. The administration will verify that the student has made an attempt to resolve the incident or complaint.&nbsp;If the student has followed the above steps, administration will call a grievance session and include all of the concerned parties. Each party involved may be asked to present their version of the incident prior to all parties being present. The person against whom the complaint is filed shall receive written notice which shall include the initial report, the factual allegations, a list of witnesses and evidence.

<h2 id="student-records-and-transcripts"><strong>Student Records and Transcripts</strong></h2>
<p>Student records for all students are kept for five years. Transcripts are kept permanently. Students may inspect and review their educational records. To do so, a student should submit a written request identifying the specific information to be reviewed. Should a student find, upon review, that records that are inaccurate or misleading, the student may request that errors be corrected. In the event that a difference of opinion exists regarding the existence of errors, a student may ask that a meeting be held to resolve the matter. Each student’s file will contain student’s records including a copy of the signed enrollment agreement, Certificate of Completion, transcript of grades earned, copies of all documents signed by the student including contract, financial ledger, refund information as applicable, complaints received from the student or student advisories related to academic progress. Transcripts will only be released to the student upon receipt of a written request. No transcript will be issued until all tuition and other fees due the institution are paid current.</p>
<h2 id="students-right-to-cancellation-withdrawal--refunds"><strong>Student’s Right to Cancellation, Withdrawal, &amp; Refunds</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Cancellation Policy &amp; 100% Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>If you cancel your enrollment, all payments made by you or on your behalf will be refunded under this 100% Refund Policy.&nbsp;You may cancel your enrollment and receive a full refund of 100% any time within 14 calendar days from either:</p>
<ol>
<li>the date you sign your enrollment agreement,</li>
<li>the date you make an initial payment,</li>
<li>first log-in to the program as shown in the Platform activity logs recording /first log-in to any communication channel between TripleTen and the student, or</li>
<li>the program Start Date, whichever is later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Cancellation &amp; Withdrawal can be initiated by submitting the <strong>TripleTen Withdrawal Request Form</strong> found here: <a href="https://docs.tripleten.com/support/refunds.html">TripleTen Refunds</a>. In the event of dispute over timely notice, the burden of proof of service rests on the student.</p>
<p>Any student will also receive a refund of all monies paid if any of the following circumstances occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>The enrollment of the student was procured as the result of any misrepresentation through advertising, promotional materials, or representations by the owner or representative of the school</li>
<li>TripleTen cancels the program, or</li>
<li>TripleTen ceases operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Withdrawal &amp; Pro Rata Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>For purposes of calculating a refund, the date of withdrawal/drop is the date when the Withdrawal Request was received by TripleTen and/or when the student is notified of termination for a violation of a published school policy which provides for termination, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>Students may notify TripleTen of their intent to withdraw and initiate the withdrawal process by completing the TripleTen Withdrawal Request Form found here: <a href="https://docs.tripleten.com/support/refunds.html">TripleTen Refunds</a>. When a student drops, TripleTen will determine how much of the tuition and fees the student is eligible to receive based on the institutional Pro Rata Refund Calculation Policy below. After calculations are applied, a student may owe a balance to TripleTen, depending upon payments made by the date of withdrawal/drop.</p>
<p>If the student withdraws at any point beyond the cancellation period (14th day after beginning the program as defined in the Cancellation Policy), the refund policy for students who have completed 60 percent or less of the enrollment period shall be a pro rata refund. A pro rata refund shall be no less than the total amount owed by the student for the portion of the educational program provided, subtracted from the amount paid by the student, calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount owed equals the daily charge for the program (total institutional charge, divided by the number of days in the enrollment period for the program), multiplied by the number of days student was scheduled to enroll, prior to withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The refund is calculated using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the total charges agreed for the enrollment period for that student, as stated on their enrollment agreement.</li>
<li>Divide this figure by the total number of calendar days constituting the enrollment period.</li>
<li>The calculation in step 2 yields the daily charge.</li>
<li>The amount owed by the student for instruction received is derived by multiplying the total calendar days in the period of attendance as of the student’s last date of attendance by the daily charge.</li>
<li>The refund shall be any amount in excess of the figure derived in step 4 that was paid by the student.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students are not eligible to receive any refund following the completion of more than 60% of the enrollment period for the program.</p>
<p>The institution shall issue a refund for unearned institutional charges within 30 days of a student’s cancellation or withdrawal.</p>
<p>Enrollment period for the purposes of the Refund Policy (calendar days):</p>
