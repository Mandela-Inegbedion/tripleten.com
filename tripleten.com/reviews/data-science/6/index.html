When I was first looking for something different to do in a career, I researched a lot of different bootcamps. I honestly didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I had been wanting something that would give me access to work remote and have flexible hours, I have a daughter that I love to spend time with. I came across TripleTen by an Ad on IG. I decided to look more into it. Originally, I was going to take the Business Analytics course as I have been a Finance Manager before and it was only 4 months. After taking the quiz I realized Data Science was the way to go. Over the past few months, it has been challenging but very rewarding. I love the interactive platforms; the projects are hard BUT the access to previous questions asked by other graduates and tutors makes completing the task doable. I am a few projects from finishing, and I cannot wait to see what I can get next. I recommend this to my friends any chance I get. If I could give advice to anyone, I would say don’t give up and if you don’t know, ASK. Someone is always willing to provide help when needed.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Furkan&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710446400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As a professional seeking to pivot into the dynamic field of data science, I embarked on a journey to learn the necessary skills to thrive in this rapidly evolving industry. My decision to delve into data science was driven by a passion for uncovering actionable insights from data and leveraging them to drive informed decision-making across various domains.When researching platforms to kickstart my coding journey, I was drawn to TripleTen for its comprehensive approach to learning data science, data analysis, and business intelligence (BI) analysis.

Reinforce your learning by actively practicing coding skills and applying them to real-world scenarios.Explore new concepts, tools, and technologies to continuously expand your knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of data science.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brian McElroy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710878400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My experience, as someone who had already acquired a number of Data Science skills in undergrad from working on publications involving big data, is that TripleTen is still worth it if you are looking to break into one of the four industries they currently support. Yes, I knew coding, statistics, data collection, SQL and machine learning going into the program, but I soon discovered there are industry-specific libraries, frameworks, and practices that startups and tech companies want you to be versed in that I knew nothing about. I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Rasmus Foyer&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712520000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/66145d527799990011c5a914/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;February 2024 I started the data science bootcamp through TripleTen, driven by a passion for AI, machine learning, and the technical aspects of computer science. Despite a 10-year career in real estate, my background in engineering and love for mathematics have always steered my interests towards technology. After extensive research into various educational pathways, including reputable universities and boot camps, I concluded that TripleTen&#39;s program offers the most comprehensive curriculum to pivot into tech, particularly in the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI.

Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Thomas Kulch&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713816000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen Bootcamp shines in data science education with its hands-on curriculum, industry-aligned projects, and supportive environment.

It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve never written a single line of code either. The way the learning process is setup makes it so that people of all skill sets can learn data science. I love how I can reach out to my mentor, co-learners, and discord for help. My favorite part about TripleTen is the interactive learning platform. It definitely is way better than mindlessly following youtube videos trying to teach yourself. They have an iterative learning process that makes sure you are engaged by making you complete projects and tasks. My tip or advice for anyone thinking about joining a bootcamp from TripleTen and transitioning into tech is to just do it! It&#39;ll be the greatest decision you made in your life.

They offer a good balance of theory and application with their online lessons and projects that feel very much like what future jobs would have you do. When I need help, there are their dedicated Discord channels and tutors, who are prompt and helpful with their responses. The biggest attractor for me was the self-pacing of the course, which helps as I am a stay at home dad. In addition, they have career guidance, which I&#39;ll be looking forward to after I complete the course material. This is a plus since I&#39;m coming from an education background and hoping to break into the data sector with this program.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Byron L.&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1715976000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My journey with triple ten has been a challenging, yet exciting journey so far. The staff has been overall supportive and understanding even at times when I needed special accommodations. I chose to start the Data Scientist program because I knew I was interested in tech, but I wasn’t sure whether or not I wanted to be a software engineer. TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;data-science&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Quashawn L Melton</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen has been a rewarding experience for me.

I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/66145d527799990011c5a914/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Rasmus Foyer</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>February 2024 I started the data science bootcamp through TripleTen, driven by a passion for AI, machine learning, and the technical aspects of computer science.

My journey with TripleTen has been incredibly positive, earning it my highest recommendation: five stars. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jackson Dana</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I decided to enroll in the TripleTen Data Science program to pivot into a new, innovative, and in-demand career. I was hoping to secure a well-paying, engaging, and cutting-edge job in data science. TripleTen seemed like the perfect choice for my coding journey due to their extensive support, custom... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> coding platform, job search assistance, and the money-back guarantee if I couldn’t find a job. The positive reviews also played a significant role in my decision.During a typical week of learning at TripleTen, I dedicated several hours every day to reading the chapter information, doing the corresponding assignments, and researching deeper into many of the topics covered. During project sprints, my time was dedicated to systematically working through each part of the project, from exploratory data analysis and data visualization to meeting the project’s goal.The interactive platform and the projects were definitely my favorite parts of this program. Having a dedicated coding platform made it easy to write and run code without needing to worry about having the computing resources on my own computer or needing to install necessary libraries. The projects helped me gain confidence in applying what I learned to a hypothetical but realistic project that a company might really have.Towards the end of the program, I encountered a serious bug on the coding platform. Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Thomas Kulch</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen Bootcamp shines in data science education with its hands-on curriculum, industry-aligned projects, and supportive environment.

TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../../index.html#reviews" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../index.html" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>5</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>6</span></a><a href="../7/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>7</span></a><!----><!----><a href="../7/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen has been a rewarding experience for me. When I was first looking for something different to do in a career, I researched a lot of different bootcamps. I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do. I had been wanting something that would give me access to work remote and have flexible hours, I have a daughter that I love to spend time with. I came across TripleTen by an Ad on IG. I decided to look more into it. Originally, I was going to take the Business Analytics course as I have been a Finance Manager before and it was only 4 months. After taking the quiz I realized Data Science was the way to go. Over the past few months, it has been challenging but very rewarding. I love the interactive platforms; the projects are hard BUT the access to previous questions asked by other graduates and tutors makes completing the task doable. I am a few projects from finishing, and I cannot wait to see what I can get next. I recommend this to my friends any chance I get. If I could give advice to anyone, I would say don’t give up and if you don’t know, ASK. Someone is always willing to provide help when needed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Quashawn L Melton"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As a professional seeking to pivot into the dynamic field of data science, I embarked on a journey to learn the necessary skills to thrive in this rapidly evolving industry.

Yes, I knew coding, statistics, data collection, SQL and machine learning going into the program, but I soon discovered there are industry-specific libraries, frameworks, and practices that startups and tech companies want you to be versed in that I knew nothing about. I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brian McElroy"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-07T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"February 2024 I started the data science bootcamp through TripleTen, driven by a passion for AI, machine learning, and the technical aspects of computer science.

I was hoping to secure a well-paying, engaging, and cutting-edge job in data science. TripleTen seemed like the perfect choice for my coding journey due to their extensive support, custom coding platform, job search assistance, and the money-back guarantee if I couldn’t find a job. The positive reviews also played a significant role in my decision.During a typical week of learning at TripleTen, I dedicated several hours every day to reading the chapter information, doing the corresponding assignments, and researching deeper into many of the topics covered. During project sprints, my time was dedicated to systematically working through each part of the project, from exploratory data analysis and data visualization to meeting the project’s goal.The interactive platform and the projects were definitely my favorite parts of this program. Having a dedicated coding platform made it easy to write and run code without needing to worry about having the computing resources on my own computer or needing to install necessary libraries. The projects helped me gain confidence in applying what I learned to a hypothetical but realistic project that a company might really have.Towards the end of the program, I encountered a serious bug on the coding platform. Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jackson Dana"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen Bootcamp shines in data science education with its hands-on curriculum, industry-aligned projects, and supportive environment.

The staff has been overall supportive and understanding even at times when I needed special accommodations. I chose to start the Data Scientist program because I knew I was interested in tech, but I wasn’t sure whether or not I wanted to be a software engineer. TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Byron L."},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
