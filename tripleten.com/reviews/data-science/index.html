Though I have not secured a job at this point (I only just graduated), I can confidently say that I have acquired a great number of skills that makes me surprise myself at times. TripleTens curriculum is as depth as a 9 month program can be, and in my opinion, hits all of the essential elements that are applicable to the business side of Data Science. I say that to emphasize this point: Data Science is a massive and ever expanding field, and there is no way to cover it all in 9 months. That being said, they give you all the tools and resources to secure your foothold in the discipline. Outside of the curriculum, they provide an excellent team dedicated to your well-being and success in the program. Evgenia and Aia (my community leads) were both incredibly supportive, regularly checking in to see how I was doing as well as responding in timely manner to all of my questions and needs. They were awesome. They also provide many secondary resources, such as workshops and webinars, to help refine and expand your skills and answer any questions.The one, and really only, complaint I have is that I found feedback on some of the projects a little frustrating. I came from a prestigious university and sport program that were both built on in-depth feedback. Out of the 15 or so projects, I felt that a couple of these lacked feedback that made me feel comfortable to move onto the next module. However, this was often rectified by one-on-one interactions that filled any remaining gaps that I felt I had.Overall, I can not recommend this program enough. For those that are trying to break into the industry, refine their skills, or just want to learn for their own personal use, I would strongly suggesting giving TripleTen a look. They were great.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Juliette Rike&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707940800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42851851?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66952#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,51],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I received a scholarship for TripleTen&#39;s data science program in partnership with Women Who Code back in 2022. I entered the program with a software engineering background but wanted to gain additional insight into machine learning concepts, which TripleTen offered. I learn best by applying new skills, so I loved that TripleTen had exercises built into every chapter. You&#39;re able to reach out to instructors and tutors whenever you&#39;re stuck on a problem. The exercises also have hints built in. During the program, you have support every step of the way from everyone on TripleTen&#39;s staff. In particular, my success manager continued to check in on me when I fell behind on my studies and was able to help me get reintegrated into the program after I took hiatuses. My favorite part of the program was the chapter projects. I had a portfolio at the end of the program that I was able to talk about in interviews, and many of the skills I obtained I was able to utilize in further education and my current position. Between the projects and chapter exercises, the structure of TripleTen reenforced the concepts. I enjoyed that TripleTen had sprints but was otherwise self-paced. This is a great program if you work well with deadlines but need flexibility when it comes to progressing. Ultimately, I was very happy with the education I received at TripleTen!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Natalie&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710273600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve been working in data analytics for over 7 years, but lacked advanced analytics/data science skill sets. I knew I had this skill gap, but was always overwhelmed by ~*how*~ I should learn these skills in a comprehensive and informed way on my own. There are so many resources out there that it&#39;s overwhelming.Unfortunately, my role was impacted by tech layoffs and I decided now was a great time to invest in myself and build these skills. As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you&#39;d like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen&#39;s program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I&#39;m truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can&#39;t recommend it more highly.If you&#39;re on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Parker Shyu&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710446400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far! I have been transitioning into the tech industry for the past 3 years, and have been struggling to get my foot in the door. My previous experience entails a UX/UI Design bootcamp, a year long software contract that got terminated due to a hiring freeze in the company, and a training in Full Stack Development, along with some tangential learning on side platforms like Codecademy and Leetcode. As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I&#39;ll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different \&quot;Sprints\&quot; (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don&#39;t have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what&#39;s called a \&quot;cohort,\&quot; so that our \&quot;two-week sprint\&quot; schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that&#39;s more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to \&quot;office hours\&quot; where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I&#39;ll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can&#39;t wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tevin Wright&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711310400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to join TripleTen after doing intensive research on several boot camps, and while there are a lot of good ones out there, TripleTen stuck out because of one edge for me: Practical Projects all throughout the course. Not only this but the syllabus structure of the course is phenomenal when compared to other bootcamps.They have a calendar section where you can add it to your Google calendar/Apple calendar. You can also see it by logging into your account. I track my progress and deadlines by using my phone or tablet to see what&#39;s up for the week and I get reminders as well. I spend about 20 hours a week or more studying. There are several features TripleTen offers, namely: interactive platform, projects, learning team, community, workshops, etc. Because of my schedule, I do not participate in the workshops however it&#39;s there if you need to take part in it.TripleTen has made me transform from a beginner to a coder who has enough knowledge to work with data. To me that was the most surprising thing to me.My tips and advice: Pros: The course I am doing is Data Science, I do not have a coding background so I had to work hard to understand it but once you get the foundation it&#39;s uphill from there.The information that is in the syllabus, which you can look at before enrolling, is relevant and up to date. They are very crucial to the field and you can research this as you please alongside other boot camps to see for yourself how well put together the BootCamp courses are.The course entails projects that are practical and a reflection of the real world. You have a community where you can ask questions daily along with tutors and study sessions. While you are learning you have interactive sessions that test what you have learnt.Since the course is self-paced you MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE. If you lack it, do not waste your time, what I love about it as well is that it&#39;s in sprints which is a reflection of the workforce. If for whatever reason you have missed or are about to miss your deadline you can always contact your success manager etc and adjust the deadline.Cons: This course is intensive. tho it may say part-time for me it still has a lot of information that needs to be learned to move on to the other sprints, but again ONCE you take the time to learn the basics it&#39;s uphill from there.Information MAY be overwhelming and sometimes requires you to seek a different perspective/ video teaching like YT or other places if you&#39;re not used to reading a lot. If you&#39;re not used to a self-paced/self-learning environment where you are DISCIPLINED enough to learn things, you may have a hard time.Overall thoughts:Great if you have discipline and want practical knowledge that WILL give you an edge over your peers. Having theory is good, but showing that you can do the job is Better. If you are self-disciplined you are in for a very good experience.While it is intensive they want you to win so please do not hesitate to reach out to your success manager/ tutors/ fellow students etc.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alan M&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712606400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m a current student for the Data Science program, currently im on sprint 5 of the program. So far I have really enjoyed the program. Ive had my ups and downs with some of the subjects, but if you put the time in and ask all the questions you can overcome all the obstacles in this course. It is not an easy program but it is definitely rewarding. You just have to put the time and the work to accomplish it. The issues ive had so far ive had so far have been answered quickly and the tutors have made it easy to understand. Iva had a lot of help from Camilo and from Ivan. They are really helpful and they know how to explain the subjects very well. I am very excited with the next chapters. I have also started creating a portfolio for when im finished with this course, ill be ready to apply to various positions. I feel like i will learn a lot in the next few weeks to get ready to apply for my first Data Analyst position.

Fortunately, the staff is really down to earth and attentive. Everything from material, projects, and communication is seamless and well organized, all you have to do is put in the time to learn. There is a lot of support for you to accomplish all the goals they put in front of you as not only do you get a personal \&quot;success\&quot; mentor to ensure you are finding strategies to move forward, but also a discord server to speak with mentors, graduates, career development and other peers going through the program with you, which makes it easy to stay engage and motivated. All the information you need to complete projects is accessible and presented with a lot of care, digestible, and charming tone. although the material was all new and daunting to me. The way new information was presented through each stage of the bootcamp made it much more approachable. You get to work at your own pace and have the resources to work at a fast pace. There is always help, from tutor hours, where you can have a one-on-one with someone to go over the material further, and also the discord server where you can ask anyone from tutors, grads, or peers to help you at any moment throughout the day. Always got a response for any issue I had with the project or in general within 5 to 10 minutes max.Best part of it all is the support given after you have a concrete understanding of the profession, tools, and essential skills, they offered the opportunity to start a career acceleration program,  where you can have hands-on experience with one of the companies they are associated with. Enrolling in any bootcamp can be daunting, There is a lot to learn, and a lot to do, but Tripleten has made it a much well-grounded and enjoyable experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Blossom Cherry&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1715284800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/663db3c2b8acc11436bf103c/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am in mid of Data Science program with TripleTen and I love it so far.

Though I have not secured a job at this point (I only just graduated), I can confidently say that I have acquired a great number of skills that makes me... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> surprise myself at times. TripleTens curriculum is as depth as a 9 month program can be, and in my opinion, hits all of the essential elements that are applicable to the business side of Data Science. I say that to emphasize this point: Data Science is a massive and ever expanding field, and there is no way to cover it all in 9 months. That being said, they give you all the tools and resources to secure your foothold in the discipline. Outside of the curriculum, they provide an excellent team dedicated to your well-being and success in the program. Evgenia and Aia (my community leads) were both incredibly supportive, regularly checking in to see how I was doing as well as responding in timely manner to all of my questions and needs. They were awesome. They also provide many secondary resources, such as workshops and webinars, to help refine and expand your skills and answer any questions.The one, and really only, complaint I have is that I found feedback on some of the projects a little frustrating. I came from a prestigious university and sport program that were both built on in-depth feedback. Out of the 15 or so projects, I felt that a couple of these lacked feedback that made me feel comfortable to move onto the next module. However, this was often rectified by one-on-one interactions that filled any remaining gaps that I felt I had.Overall, I can not recommend this program enough. For those that are trying to break into the industry, refine their skills, or just want to learn for their own personal use, I would strongly suggesting giving TripleTen a look. They were great. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66452#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42851851?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Juliette Rike</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I received a scholarship for TripleTen&#39;s data science program in partnership with Women Who Code back in 2022.

You&#39;re able to reach out to instructors and tutors whenever you&#39;re stuck on a problem. The exercises also have hints built in. During the program, you have support every step of the way from everyone on TripleTen&#39;s staff. In particular, my success manager continued to check in on me when I fell behind on my studies and was able to help me get reintegrated into the program after I took hiatuses. My favorite part of the program was the chapter projects. I had a portfolio at the end of the program that I was able to talk about in interviews, and many of the skills I obtained I was able to utilize in further education and my current position. Between the projects and chapter exercises, the structure of TripleTen reenforced the concepts. I enjoyed that TripleTen had sprints but was otherwise self-paced. This is a great program if you work well with deadlines but need flexibility when it comes to progressing.

As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you&#39;d like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen&#39;s program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I&#39;m truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can&#39;t recommend it more highly.If you&#39;re on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Parker Shyu</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far!

As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I&#39;ll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different &quot;Sprints&quot; (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don&#39;t have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what&#39;s called a &quot;cohort,&quot; so that our &quot;two-week sprint&quot; schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that&#39;s more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to &quot;office hours&quot; where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I&#39;ll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can&#39;t wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tevin Wright</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I decided to join TripleTen after doing intensive research on several boot camps, and while there are a lot of good ones out there, TripleTen stuck out because of one edge for me: Practical Projects all throughout the course. Not only this but the syllabus structure of the course is phenomenal when ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>compared to other bootcamps.They have a calendar section where you can add it to your Google calendar/Apple calendar. You can also see it by logging into your account. I track my progress and deadlines by using my phone or tablet to see what&#39;s up for the week and I get reminders as well. I spend about 20 hours a week or more studying. There are several features TripleTen offers, namely: interactive platform, projects, learning team, community, workshops, etc. Because of my schedule, I do not participate in the workshops however it&#39;s there if you need to take part in it.TripleTen has made me transform from a beginner to a coder who has enough knowledge to work with data. To me that was the most surprising thing to me.My tips and advice: Pros: The course I am doing is Data Science, I do not have a coding background so I had to work hard to understand it but once you get the foundation it&#39;s uphill from there.The information that is in the syllabus, which you can look at before enrolling, is relevant and up to date. They are very crucial to the field and you can research this as you please alongside other boot camps to see for yourself how well put together the BootCamp courses are.The course entails projects that are practical and a reflection of the real world. You have a community where you can ask questions daily along with tutors and study sessions. While you are learning you have interactive sessions that test what you have learnt.Since the course is self-paced you MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE. If you lack it, do not waste your time, what I love about it as well is that it&#39;s in sprints which is a reflection of the workforce. If for whatever reason you have missed or are about to miss your deadline you can always contact your success manager etc and adjust the deadline.Cons: This course is intensive. tho it may say part-time for me it still has a lot of information that needs to be learned to move on to the other sprints, but again ONCE you take the time to learn the basics it&#39;s uphill from there.Information MAY be overwhelming and sometimes requires you to seek a different perspective/ video teaching like YT or other places if you&#39;re not used to reading a lot. If you&#39;re not used to a self-paced/self-learning environment where you are DISCIPLINED enough to learn things, you may have a hard time.Overall thoughts:Great if you have discipline and want practical knowledge that WILL give you an edge over your peers. Having theory is good, but showing that you can do the job is Better. If you are self-disciplined you are in for a very good experience.While it is intensive they want you to win so please do not hesitate to reach out to your success manager/ tutors/ fellow students etc. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alan M</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;m a current student for the Data Science program, currently im on sprint 5 of the program.

There is a lot of support for you to accomplish all the goals they put in front of you as not only do you get a personal &quot;success&quot; mentor to ensure you are finding strategies to move forward, but also a discord server to speak with mentors, graduates, career development and other peers going through the program with you, which makes it easy to stay engage and motivated. All the information you need to complete projects is accessible and presented with a lot of care, digestible, and charming tone. although the material was all new and daunting to me. The way new information was presented through each stage of the bootcamp made it much more approachable. You get to work at your own pace and have the resources to work at a fast pace. There is always help, from tutor hours, where you can have a one-on-one with someone to go over the material further, and also the discord server where you can ask anyone from tutors, grads, or peers to help you at any moment throughout the day. Always got a response for any issue I had with the project or in general within 5 to 10 minutes max.Best part of it all is the support given after you have a concrete understanding of the profession, tools, and essential skills, they offered the opportunity to start a career acceleration program,  where you can have hands-on experience with one of the companies they are associated with. Enrolling in any bootcamp can be daunting, There is a lot to learn, and a lot to do, but Tripleten has made it a much well-grounded and enjoyable experience. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68514#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/663db3c2b8acc11436bf103c/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Blossom Cherry</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am in mid of Data Science program with TripleTen and I love it so far.

I absolutely love how much I’ve learned with TripleTen and how well structured their curriculum is. You learn the skillset required to survive in the jobs market. I spend around 15-20 hours a week with TripleTen and their support stuff/tutors are always available and are always available and incredibly helpful. It’s challenging, but it’s rewarding to put in the effort.I love how much support they offer; this includes continuous workshops, coworking hours where you can get help from alumni or senior students, and tutors who are accessible throughout the day to answer any questions. Most of the projects have been enjoyable and beneficial for building my professional portfolio.TripleTen has helped me significantly in my coding journey with the way they structure the information and practical experiences from projects as well as supportive community that enhances my learning experience and my journey to becoming a data scientist. My advice to those who are just starting their coding journey is get ready to invest time and effort. If you are new to coding, then attend workshops, coworking, and study groups if you prefer. Also, don’t hesitate to ask questions. No question is ever a dumb question. It’s part of our journey to become a better data scientist or coder. Remember, the more effort you put in, the more you&#39;ll gain from this experience. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/664a711bf9916e8b23ea1002/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jerry Stanley</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>In the labyrinth of career transitions, finding the right path can feel like deciphering an intricate code.

After extensive research and soul-searching, I chose TripleTen as my guide into this promising domain. Now, as I navigate through their bootcamp, I find myself compelled to share my experiences, hoping to illuminate the path for others considering a similar leap.From the moment I delved into TripleTen&#39;s curriculum, I sensed a harmonious blend of structure and flexibility. As someone transitioning into a new field, the structured approach provided me with a solid framework to build upon. Yet, it was the flexibility that allowed me to tailor my learning experience to suit my pace and preferences. Whether I craved a deep dive into machine learning algorithms or sought clarity on statistical concepts, TripleTen&#39;s platform accommodated my needs with ease.One of the standout features of TripleTen&#39;s bootcamp is its interactive platform. Gone are the days of passive learning, where one merely absorbs information from static textbooks or lectures. Instead, TripleTen fosters an environment where learning is an active, engaging process. Through interactive modules, coding challenges, and real-world projects, I found myself not just understanding the concepts but actually applying them in meaningful ways. This hands-on approach not only solidified my understanding but also ignited a sense of excitement and curiosity within me.Central to my positive experience with TripleTen has been the support network they&#39;ve cultivated. The project reviewers and tutors, with their expertise and guidance, have been invaluable allies in my journey. Whether I hit a roadblock in my coding endeavors or grappled with complex statistical concepts, I always found assistance just a click away. Their constructive feedback and insightful suggestions have propelled my learning forward, transforming daunting challenges into opportunities for growth.Moreover, TripleTen&#39;s emphasis on real-world applications has been a game-changer for me. Rather than being confined to theoretical exercises, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work on projects that mirror the challenges and complexities of the industry. These projects not only bolstered my technical skills but also honed my ability to think critically and solve problems creatively. As I tackled datasets, wrangled with messy data, and derived actionable insights, I felt a sense of empowerment knowing that I was gaining skills directly applicable to my future career.Beyond the educational aspect, TripleTen&#39;s commitment to job placement has instilled me with confidence as I transition into the professional realm. The prospect of embarking on a new career can be daunting, but TripleTen&#39;s career support team has been a steady beacon of guidance and encouragement. From resume crafting to interview preparation, they&#39;ve equipped me with the tools and strategies needed to navigate the job market with confidence. Moreover, the network of alumni and industry connections they provide has opened doors to opportunities I never thought possible.Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that choosing TripleTen was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made for my career. From the engaging curriculum to the unwavering support, every aspect of the bootcamp has exceeded my expectations. As I eagerly anticipate the next phase of my journey – transitioning into the workforce – I do so with a profound sense of gratitude for the foundation TripleTen has provided me.In conclusion, if you&#39;re considering a career in tech, particularly in the dynamic field of data science, I wholeheartedly recommend TripleTen.

Though I have not secured a job at this point (I only just graduated), I can confidently say that I have acquired a great number of skills that makes me surprise myself at times. TripleTens curriculum is as depth as a 9 month program can be, and in my opinion, hits all of the essential elements that are applicable to the business side of Data Science. I say that to emphasize this point: Data Science is a massive and ever expanding field, and there is no way to cover it all in 9 months. That being said, they give you all the tools and resources to secure your foothold in the discipline. Outside of the curriculum, they provide an excellent team dedicated to your well-being and success in the program. Evgenia and Aia (my community leads) were both incredibly supportive, regularly checking in to see how I was doing as well as responding in timely manner to all of my questions and needs. They were awesome. They also provide many secondary resources, such as workshops and webinars, to help refine and expand your skills and answer any questions.The one, and really only, complaint I have is that I found feedback on some of the projects a little frustrating. I came from a prestigious university and sport program that were both built on in-depth feedback. Out of the 15 or so projects, I felt that a couple of these lacked feedback that made me feel comfortable to move onto the next module. However, this was often rectified by one-on-one interactions that filled any remaining gaps that I felt I had.Overall, I can not recommend this program enough. For those that are trying to break into the industry, refine their skills, or just want to learn for their own personal use, I would strongly suggesting giving TripleTen a look. They were great.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Le Vine"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I received a scholarship for TripleTen's data science program in partnership with Women Who Code back in 2022. I entered the program with a software engineering background but wanted to gain additional insight into machine learning concepts, which TripleTen offered. I learn best by applying new skills, so I loved that TripleTen had exercises built into every chapter. You're able to reach out to instructors and tutors whenever you're stuck on a problem. The exercises also have hints built in. During the program, you have support every step of the way from everyone on TripleTen's staff. In particular, my success manager continued to check in on me when I fell behind on my studies and was able to help me get reintegrated into the program after I took hiatuses. My favorite part of the program was the chapter projects. I had a portfolio at the end of the program that I was able to talk about in interviews, and many of the skills I obtained I was able to utilize in further education and my current position. Between the projects and chapter exercises, the structure of TripleTen reenforced the concepts. I enjoyed that TripleTen had sprints but was otherwise self-paced. This is a great program if you work well with deadlines but need flexibility when it comes to progressing. Ultimately, I was very happy with the education I received at TripleTen!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Juliette Rike"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've been working in data analytics for over 7 years, but lacked advanced analytics/data science skill sets. I knew I had this skill gap, but was always overwhelmed by ~*how*~ I should learn these skills in a comprehensive and informed way on my own. There are so many resources out there that it's overwhelming.Unfortunately, my role was impacted by tech layoffs and I decided now was a great time to invest in myself and build these skills. As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you'd like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen's program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I'm truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can't recommend it more highly.If you're on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Natalie"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far! I have been transitioning into the tech industry for the past 3 years, and have been struggling to get my foot in the door. My previous experience entails a UX/UI Design bootcamp, a year long software contract that got terminated due to a hiring freeze in the company, and a training in Full Stack Development, along with some tangential learning on side platforms like Codecademy and Leetcode. As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I'll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different \"Sprints\" (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don't have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what's called a \"cohort,\" so that our \"two-week sprint\" schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that's more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to \"office hours\" where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I'll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can't wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Parker Shyu"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-24T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I decided to join TripleTen after doing intensive research on several boot camps, and while there are a lot of good ones out there, TripleTen stuck out because of one edge for me: Practical Projects all throughout the course. Not only this but the syllabus structure of the course is phenomenal when compared to other bootcamps.They have a calendar section where you can add it to your Google calendar/Apple calendar. You can also see it by logging into your account. I track my progress and deadlines by using my phone or tablet to see what's up for the week and I get reminders as well. I spend about 20 hours a week or more studying. There are several features TripleTen offers, namely: interactive platform, projects, learning team, community, workshops, etc. Because of my schedule, I do not participate in the workshops however it's there if you need to take part in it.TripleTen has made me transform from a beginner to a coder who has enough knowledge to work with data. To me that was the most surprising thing to me.My tips and advice: Pros: The course I am doing is Data Science, I do not have a coding background so I had to work hard to understand it but once you get the foundation it's uphill from there.The information that is in the syllabus, which you can look at before enrolling, is relevant and up to date. They are very crucial to the field and you can research this as you please alongside other boot camps to see for yourself how well put together the BootCamp courses are.The course entails projects that are practical and a reflection of the real world. You have a community where you can ask questions daily along with tutors and study sessions. While you are learning you have interactive sessions that test what you have learnt.Since the course is self-paced you MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE. If you lack it, do not waste your time, what I love about it as well is that it's in sprints which is a reflection of the workforce. If for whatever reason you have missed or are about to miss your deadline you can always contact your success manager etc and adjust the deadline.Cons: This course is intensive. tho it may say part-time for me it still has a lot of information that needs to be learned to move on to the other sprints, but again ONCE you take the time to learn the basics it's uphill from there.Information MAY be overwhelming and sometimes requires you to seek a different perspective/ video teaching like YT or other places if you're not used to reading a lot. If you're not used to a self-paced/self-learning environment where you are DISCIPLINED enough to learn things, you may have a hard time.Overall thoughts:Great if you have discipline and want practical knowledge that WILL give you an edge over your peers. Having theory is good, but showing that you can do the job is Better. If you are self-disciplined you are in for a very good experience.While it is intensive they want you to win so please do not hesitate to reach out to your success manager/ tutors/ fellow students etc.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tevin Wright"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-08T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I'm a current student for the Data Science program, currently im on sprint 5 of the program. So far I have really enjoyed the program. Ive had my ups and downs with some of the subjects, but if you put the time in and ask all the questions you can overcome all the obstacles in this course. It is not an easy program but it is definitely rewarding. You just have to put the time and the work to accomplish it. The issues ive had so far ive had so far have been answered quickly and the tutors have made it easy to understand. Iva had a lot of help from Camilo and from Ivan. They are really helpful and they know how to explain the subjects very well. I am very excited with the next chapters. I have also started creating a portfolio for when im finished with this course, ill be ready to apply to various positions.

Fortunately, the staff is really down to earth and attentive. Everything from material, projects, and communication is seamless and well organized, all you have to do is put in the time to learn. There is a lot of support for you to accomplish all the goals they put in front of you as not only do you get a personal \"success\" mentor to ensure you are finding strategies to move forward, but also a discord server to speak with mentors, graduates, career development and other peers going through the program with you, which makes it easy to stay engage and motivated. All the information you need to complete projects is accessible and presented with a lot of care, digestible, and charming tone. although the material was all new and daunting to me. The way new information was presented through each stage of the bootcamp made it much more approachable. You get to work at your own pace and have the resources to work at a fast pace. There is always help, from tutor hours, where you can have a one-on-one with someone to go over the material further, and also the discord server where you can ask anyone from tutors, grads, or peers to help you at any moment throughout the day. Always got a response for any issue I had with the project or in general within 5 to 10 minutes max.Best part of it all is the support given after you have a concrete understanding of the profession, tools, and essential skills, they offered the opportunity to start a career acceleration program,  where you can have hands-on experience with one of the companies they are associated with. Enrolling in any bootcamp can be daunting, There is a lot to learn, and a lot to do, but Tripleten has made it a much well-grounded and enjoyable experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elias H"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am in mid of Data Science program with TripleTen and I love it so far. I decided to pursue Data Science because during my courses for computer science I absolutely loved Python and SQL and I knew that I wanted to learn more about data science. As I near the completion of my computer science degree, I've realized that university courses often lack the hands on experience that TripleTen offers. I absolutely love how much I’ve learned with TripleTen and how well structured their curriculum is. You learn the skillset required to survive in the jobs market. I spend around 15-20 hours a week with TripleTen and their support stuff/tutors are always available and are always available and incredibly helpful. It’s challenging, but it’s rewarding to put in the effort.I love how much support they offer; this includes continuous workshops, coworking hours where you can get help from alumni or senior students, and tutors who are accessible throughout the day to answer any questions. Most of the projects have been enjoyable and beneficial for building my professional portfolio.TripleTen has helped me significantly in my coding journey with the way they structure the information and practical experiences from projects as well as supportive community that enhances my learning experience and my journey to becoming a data scientist. My advice to those who are just starting their coding journey is get ready to invest time and effort. If you are new to coding, then attend workshops, coworking, and study groups if you prefer. Also, don’t hesitate to ask questions. No question is ever a dumb question. It’s part of our journey to become a better data scientist or coder. Remember, the more effort you put in, the more you'll gain from this experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Blossom Cherry"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-18T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"In the labyrinth of career transitions, finding the right path can feel like deciphering an intricate code.
