The bootcamp provided me with an immersive and comprehensive learning environment. The course covered a wide range of topics, including data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and more. The content was presented in a logical and progressive manner, allowing me to build a solid foundation before delving into more advanced concepts. Each module was accompanied by practical exercises and real-world projects, which greatly enhanced my understanding and provided valuable hands-on experience. Overall, my experience with Triple Ten Datascience Bootcamp has been exceptional till now. It provided me with a solid foundation in data science, equipped me with practical skills, and boosted my confidence to pursue a career in the field. The well-designed curriculum, dedicated instructors, collaborative environment, and comprehensive career support make Practicum an outstanding choice for anyone looking to kickstart their journey in data science. I highly recommend this bootcamp to aspiring data scientists seeking a transformative learning experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anthony Steven Callender&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687291200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Pros: I recently had the pleasure of experiencing TripleTen, and I must say it&#39;s an exceptional learning platform that offers numerous advantages. Here are the key pros that stood out to me: User-Friendly and Interactive Platform: TripleTen provides a remarkably user-friendly interface, making it easy for learners to navigate and engage with the content. The interactive features enhance the learning experience, ensuring active participation and knowledge retention. Asynchronous Learning: One of the standout features of TripleTen is its asynchronous learning approach. This flexibility allows learners to set their own pace and conveniently access course materials whenever and wherever they prefer, accommodating various schedules and learning styles. Unmatched Flexibility: TripleTen offers unparalleled flexibility, enabling learners to customize their learning journey. The platform provides a diverse range of courses and subjects, ensuring that individuals can tailor their educational experience to their specific interests and goals. Networking Opportunities: TripleTen goes beyond traditional learning by fostering networking opportunities. Learners can connect with like-minded individuals, industry experts, and mentors, creating valuable professional connections and expanding their networks. Exceptional Tutors: TripleTen boasts a team of outstanding tutors who possess deep expertise and industry experience. Their guidance and support play a pivotal role in facilitating effective learning, ensuring learners receive a top-quality education. Real-Life Business Portfolio Projects: TripleTen stands out by incorporating real-life business portfolio projects into its curriculum. This practical approach allows learners to apply their newly acquired skills to real-world scenarios, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and preparing them for professional challenges. Externships: TripleTen provides an exciting opportunity for learners to gain practical experience through externships. These hands-on experiences enable individuals to work with industry professionals and apply their knowledge in a real work environment, further solidifying their skills. Cons: While TripleTen offers an outstanding learning experience, there are a few areas that could benefit from improvement. Here is one area that I believe requires attention: Limited Sandbox Opportunities: Although the sandbox feature on TripleTen offers a great opportunity for practical application, it is currently limited to Exploratory Data Analysis and Python (for the data science course I took at least). It would be advantageous for TripleTen to expand this feature to include popular topics like machine learning. This expansion would provide learners with a more comprehensive hands-on experience across a broader range of subjects. Overall, TripleTen is an exceptional learning platform that excels in user-friendliness, asynchronous learning, flexibility, networking opportunities, great tutors, real-life business projects, and externships. With some enhancements to the sandbox feature, it has the potential to become an even more comprehensive and diverse learning ecosystem.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Joshua Norfolk&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687723200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60546#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I chose to try to enter the data science field a few years after graduating with my B.S. in physics. I chose not to enter into a technical field after graduating, because I was tired of struggling to understand processes that seemed insurmountably difficult, such as learning to code and using these languages to analyze experimental data. After a few years of working in other fields (and coincidentally meeting other data scientists in my personal life), I decided to check out the current state of the coding world, and landed on data science as the most logical blend of my interests and experience. I began to brush up on the coding language Python using old videos I had saved from school, and eventually using Codecademy. These initial steps showed me that coding could be, at worst, frustrating but possible to learn, and at best, fun. I learned a good bit through these platforms, but I had trouble pushing myself to explore new ground, because I had nobody to provide validation for my work, and solutions were readily available. I applied to a lot of jobs, and even made it through most of an interview process, but ultimately kept falling short.\n               Enter TripleTen (formerly known as Practicum) – I liked the idea of frequently working on highly independent projects that would be reviewed by working professionals, completing externships with companies to gain more real-world experience, and taking advantage of their career services program upon graduation. I think the information is presented well, and contains topics that one who is learning independently might not stumble upon – basic software engineering, building applications, advanced math, like some linear algebra and calculus, and more. I took many math classes on linear algebra in my undergrad, but TripleTen’s presentation of the topic and its integration with data science has allowed me to much more fully understand its real-world applications. \n               I work full-time, spending about 44 hours a week away from home for work. I have hobbies, and responsibilities at home, but no dependents, and personally I am able to handle the workload pretty well. I do not track my time precisely, but 15-20 hours spent per week on the program is probably accurate. Community learning events are offered, like workshops and co-working, though I have mostly focused on moving through the curriculum itself. The code reviewers leave valuable feedback, and you can tell they invest time into reviewing your work. The same person will review your projects once you reach a certain point in the program, which helps build familiarity. I haven’t yet started the career support or acceleration programs, but I am looking forward to it, as it seems like a very valuable offering. The program also offers generous scholarships for recent grads, or at least when I enrolled. \n               I have not started any externships, or other extra-curricular projects, yet, because I only recently reached the point in the program where I am able to participate, and none are available right now, but I am excited to start as soon as possible. It would be nice if they were available more often. They are also available throughout the 6 months of career acceleration post-curriculum. Overall, I would recommend this program to both beginners and to people with some experience. I have not really started my search for a new job, so I cannot speak to my final outcome, but I feel optimistic. Recruiters for not-explicitly-data-science related jobs have seemed impressed when I tell them about this program, so that’s something tangible that supports my optimism! \n               I always heard that learning to code follows a hilly curve where at first it seems easy, then hard, then you feel like a master, then it feels like it is all impossible, and so on. I have found some truth in that. In college, I never made it past the first hump. Now that I have spent a while learning it all, I feel like I have passed that initial hump, plus another hump or two! It is simply a collection of skills that needs learned and practiced. TripleTen offers a robust environment in which to accomplish this, at a great monetary value, especially with any discounts/scholarships that are available.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Powers&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687723200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This company does a fantastic job of supplying very useful information in a concise way. Another thing I love is that sometimes they will give you an introduction to a topic but then offer links to you to explore if you want to learn more about it. The projects are very applicable to the real world and will definitely help you build a portfolio advertising a very wide variety of skills. My only constructive criticism I would offer is the skills seem not too difficult at the start, but the leap from lessons to projects can sometimes be pretty substantial. I am still in progress and have not gotten a new job yet or tried an externship, but looking forward to both.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Quynh Nguyen&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687723200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to transition to a new career after being a burnt-out dental assistant for 3 years. I decided to take the data science bootcamp at TripleTen (formerly known as Practicum) and it has been an amazing experience. The reasons why I chose TripeTen because it a part-time program, engaging community, comprehensive curriculum , and reasonable price. The topic ranges from data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. TripleTen provides plenty of resources to help students succeed with their studies with office hours and workshops . It can be a little overwhelming sometimes with the dense informations but tutors and the community managers are always there to help when needed. The tutors have been super helpful with my learning process; whenever I struggle with a problem within a sprint or with a project, they are available to help and provide a thorough explanation. One of my favorite things about the program is the project after each sprint, which allows you to apply what you have learned into practical and real life project. Then reviewers give you feedback to improve your project until it is approved. My community manager always check in to see how I am doing, which I appreciate. Overall, TripeTen offers a comprehensive, interactive, and well-structured curriculum, making it an excellent choice for beginners with no prior coding experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ahmad Hijazi&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687982400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47305630?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60668#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started this data science journey to transition into an exciting new field from engineering. I compared several bootcamps prior to selecting TripleTen and it was the best fit for me due to the flexible study schedule, breadth of the curriculum, continuous support from the community managers &amp; tutors, and affordability.I liked TripleTen&#39;s interactive platform with real-world tasks in each sprint, which makes it easy to see the value in the material, and how it can be applied to solving data science problems. The sprint projects are also real-world tasks, optimized to focus on material from the sprint and put the knowledge to practice.  TripleTen&#39;s comprehensive data science program has helped me learn Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, Git, and machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised for classification and regression tasks. Even though support is readily available from tutors during office hours and quick-to-respond community managers, I encourage you to challenge yourself and not ask for help until you&#39;ve really tried as this will make the solution more rewarding and memorable.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Levy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1688241600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have completed the first third of the Data Science Bootcamp as of today. I decided to go with TripleTen (Originally Practicum when I was researching programs) after several weeks of investigating various online Data Science Bootcamps. One of the biggest selling points for me was the opportunity to do work for a real company while in the program. I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module&#39;s discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends. Overall I feel like it is a great program and I highly recommend it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brandi Booth&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1688673600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130495796?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60919#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to start learning Data Science because solving problems interest me.  I&#39;d like to have a work from home position where what I do uniquely helps the company.  I have an analytical personality and I am good at analyzing details.The training platform is helpful because there is theoretical learning.  Like it explains the new topics and then backs it up with code for you to do the work of what you just learned.  The projects give you a chance to work on real world business topics that you might actually do in the field.  The tutors are helpful when you can get one.  I don&#39;t like that its challenging to casually get explaination for things you may not understand.   Code reviewers are tough, sometimes they give a hard time.  Community managers are as helpful as can be.  The other classmates are golden, and a great support system.\nI am learning new skills and concepts I never even thought of, and I think I will be able actually do the skills needed. I just am really hopeful I will be able to get a great job in this field.  I chose TripleTen because of the gaurnatee  for the job.  The program is really challenging and it takes a lot of dedication.  Just have to trust that the team here is training us well and we will acquire good paying work in our field.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brandi Booth&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1690142400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen has a good online community with study buddies 5 days a week, and teambuilding if you take advantage of opportunities with cohort members. The community is one of the best parts. Tutors seem less available once you&#39;re in the program for months. They also want specific questions verses,\&quot; I don&#39;t understand, please help\&quot; approach. This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Chandra Fase&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1690315200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in marketing and wanted to branch out into the more analytic side.

The real world projects and tasks throughout the lessons help tremendously with the visual/hands-on learning person that I am. The tutors and project reviewers are great at giving you additional resources if needed and explaining how to come up with solutions rather than just giving you an answer.

Cons: While TripleTen offers an outstanding learning experience, there are a few areas that could benefit from improvement. Here is one area that I believe requires attention: Limited Sandbox Opportunities: Although the sandbox feature on TripleTen offers a great opportunity for practical application, it is currently limited to Exploratory Data Analysis and Python (for the data science course I took at least). It would be advantageous for TripleTen to expand this feature to include popular topics like machine learning. This expansion would provide learners with a more comprehensive hands-on experience across a broader range of subjects. Overall, TripleTen is an exceptional learning platform that excels in user-friendliness, asynchronous learning, flexibility, networking opportunities, great tutors, real-life business projects, and externships. With some enhancements to the sandbox feature, it has the potential to become an even more comprehensive and diverse learning ecosystem. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Joshua Norfolk</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose to try to enter the data science field a few years after graduating with my B.S. in physics.

After a few years of working in other fields (and coincidentally meeting other data scientists in my personal life), I decided to check out the current state of the coding world, and landed on data science as the most logical blend of my interests and experience. I began to brush up on the coding language Python using old videos I had saved from school, and eventually using Codecademy. These initial steps showed me that coding could be, at worst, frustrating but possible to learn, and at best, fun. I learned a good bit through these platforms, but I had trouble pushing myself to explore new ground, because I had nobody to provide validation for my work, and solutions were readily available. I applied to a lot of jobs, and even made it through most of an interview process, but ultimately kept falling short.
               Enter TripleTen (formerly known as Practicum) – I liked the idea of frequently working on highly independent projects that would be reviewed by working professionals, completing externships with companies to gain more real-world experience, and taking advantage of their career services program upon graduation. I think the information is presented well, and contains topics that one who is learning independently might not stumble upon – basic software engineering, building applications, advanced math, like some linear algebra and calculus, and more. I took many math classes on linear algebra in my undergrad, but TripleTen’s presentation of the topic and its integration with data science has allowed me to much more fully understand its real-world applications. 
               I work full-time, spending about 44 hours a week away from home for work. I have hobbies, and responsibilities at home, but no dependents, and personally I am able to handle the workload pretty well. I do not track my time precisely, but 15-20 hours spent per week on the program is probably accurate. Community learning events are offered, like workshops and co-working, though I have mostly focused on moving through the curriculum itself. The code reviewers leave valuable feedback, and you can tell they invest time into reviewing your work. The same person will review your projects once you reach a certain point in the program, which helps build familiarity. I haven’t yet started the career support or acceleration programs, but I am looking forward to it, as it seems like a very valuable offering. The program also offers generous scholarships for recent grads, or at least when I enrolled. 
               I have not started any externships, or other extra-curricular projects, yet, because I only recently reached the point in the program where I am able to participate, and none are available right now, but I am excited to start as soon as possible. It would be nice if they were available more often. They are also available throughout the 6 months of career acceleration post-curriculum. Overall, I would recommend this program to both beginners and to people with some experience. I have not really started my search for a new job, so I cannot speak to my final outcome, but I feel optimistic. Recruiters for not-explicitly-data-science related jobs have seemed impressed when I tell them about this program, so that’s something tangible that supports my optimism! 
               I always heard that learning to code follows a hilly curve where at first it seems easy, then hard, then you feel like a master, then it feels like it is all impossible, and so on. I have found some truth in that. In college, I never made it past the first hump. Now that I have spent a while learning it all, I feel like I have passed that initial hump, plus another hump or two! It is simply a collection of skills that needs learned and practiced. TripleTen offers a robust environment in which to accomplish this, at a great monetary value, especially with any discounts/scholarships that are available. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60546#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michael Powers</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>This company does a fantastic job of supplying very useful information in a concise way.

It can be a little overwhelming sometimes with the dense informations but tutors and the community managers are always there to help when needed. The tutors have been super helpful with my learning process; whenever I struggle with a problem within a sprint or with a project, they are available to help and provide a thorough explanation. One of my favorite things about the program is the project after each sprint, which allows you to apply what you have learned into practical and real life project. Then reviewers give you feedback to improve your project until it is approved. My community manager always check in to see how I am doing, which I appreciate.

I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module&#39;s discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends.

This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Chandra Fase</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in marketing and wanted to branch out into the more analytic side.

Cons: While TripleTen offers an outstanding learning experience, there are a few areas that could benefit from improvement. Here is one area that I believe requires attention: Limited Sandbox Opportunities: Although the sandbox feature on TripleTen offers a great opportunity for practical application, it is currently limited to Exploratory Data Analysis and Python (for the data science course I took at least). It would be advantageous for TripleTen to expand this feature to include popular topics like machine learning. This expansion would provide learners with a more comprehensive hands-on experience across a broader range of subjects. Overall, TripleTen is an exceptional learning platform that excels in user-friendliness, asynchronous learning, flexibility, networking opportunities, great tutors, real-life business projects, and externships. With some enhancements to the sandbox feature, it has the potential to become an even more comprehensive and diverse learning ecosystem.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anthony Steven Callender"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I chose to try to enter the data science field a few years after graduating with my B.S. in physics. I chose not to enter into a technical field after graduating, because I was tired of struggling to understand processes that seemed insurmountably difficult, such as learning to code and using these languages to analyze experimental data. After a few years of working in other fields (and coincidentally meeting other data scientists in my personal life), I decided to check out the current state of the coding world, and landed on data science as the most logical blend of my interests and experience. I began to brush up on the coding language Python using old videos I had saved from school, and eventually using Codecademy. These initial steps showed me that coding could be, at worst, frustrating but possible to learn, and at best, fun. I learned a good bit through these platforms, but I had trouble pushing myself to explore new ground, because I had nobody to provide validation for my work, and solutions were readily available. I applied to a lot of jobs, and even made it through most of an interview process, but ultimately kept falling short.\n               Enter TripleTen (formerly known as Practicum) – I liked the idea of frequently working on highly independent projects that would be reviewed by working professionals, completing externships with companies to gain more real-world experience, and taking advantage of their career services program upon graduation. I think the information is presented well, and contains topics that one who is learning independently might not stumble upon – basic software engineering, building applications, advanced math, like some linear algebra and calculus, and more. I took many math classes on linear algebra in my undergrad, but TripleTen’s presentation of the topic and its integration with data science has allowed me to much more fully understand its real-world applications. \n               I work full-time, spending about 44 hours a week away from home for work. I have hobbies, and responsibilities at home, but no dependents, and personally I am able to handle the workload pretty well. I do not track my time precisely, but 15-20 hours spent per week on the program is probably accurate. Community learning events are offered, like workshops and co-working, though I have mostly focused on moving through the curriculum itself. The code reviewers leave valuable feedback, and you can tell they invest time into reviewing your work. The same person will review your projects once you reach a certain point in the program, which helps build familiarity. I haven’t yet started the career support or acceleration programs, but I am looking forward to it, as it seems like a very valuable offering. The program also offers generous scholarships for recent grads, or at least when I enrolled. \n               I have not started any externships, or other extra-curricular projects, yet, because I only recently reached the point in the program where I am able to participate, and none are available right now, but I am excited to start as soon as possible. It would be nice if they were available more often. They are also available throughout the 6 months of career acceleration post-curriculum. Overall, I would recommend this program to both beginners and to people with some experience. I have not really started my search for a new job, so I cannot speak to my final outcome, but I feel optimistic. Recruiters for not-explicitly-data-science related jobs have seemed impressed when I tell them about this program, so that’s something tangible that supports my optimism! \n               I always heard that learning to code follows a hilly curve where at first it seems easy, then hard, then you feel like a master, then it feels like it is all impossible, and so on. I have found some truth in that. In college, I never made it past the first hump. Now that I have spent a while learning it all, I feel like I have passed that initial hump, plus another hump or two! It is simply a collection of skills that needs learned and practiced. TripleTen offers a robust environment in which to accomplish this, at a great monetary value, especially with any discounts/scholarships that are available.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joshua Norfolk"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This company does a fantastic job of supplying very useful information in a concise way.

The projects are very applicable to the real world and will definitely help you build a portfolio advertising a very wide variety of skills. My only constructive criticism I would offer is the skills seem not too difficult at the start, but the leap from lessons to projects can sometimes be pretty substantial.

The reasons why I chose TripeTen because it a part-time program, engaging community, comprehensive curriculum , and reasonable price. The topic ranges from data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. TripleTen provides plenty of resources to help students succeed with their studies with office hours and workshops . It can be a little overwhelming sometimes with the dense informations but tutors and the community managers are always there to help when needed. The tutors have been super helpful with my learning process; whenever I struggle with a problem within a sprint or with a project, they are available to help and provide a thorough explanation. One of my favorite things about the program is the project after each sprint, which allows you to apply what you have learned into practical and real life project. Then reviewers give you feedback to improve your project until it is approved. My community manager always check in to see how I am doing, which I appreciate. Overall, TripeTen offers a comprehensive, interactive, and well-structured curriculum, making it an excellent choice for beginners with no prior coding experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Quynh Nguyen"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started this data science journey to transition into an exciting new field from engineering.

The sprint projects are also real-world tasks, optimized to focus on material from the sprint and put the knowledge to practice.  TripleTen's comprehensive data science program has helped me learn Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, Git, and machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised for classification and regression tasks. Even though support is readily available from tutors during office hours and quick-to-respond community managers, I encourage you to challenge yourself and not ask for help until you've really tried as this will make the solution more rewarding and memorable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ahmad Hijazi"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-01T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have completed the first third of the Data Science Bootcamp as of today. I decided to go with TripleTen (Originally Practicum when I was researching programs) after several weeks of investigating various online Data Science Bootcamps. One of the biggest selling points for me was the opportunity to do work for a real company while in the program. I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module's discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends.

The community is one of the best parts. Tutors seem less available once you're in the program for months. They also want specific questions verses,\" I don't understand, please help\" approach. This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brandi Booth"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have a bachelor's degree in marketing and wanted to branch out into the more analytic side. After lots of research, I decided with TripleTen based on their reviews and career placement guarantee. I had no experience with coding prior to this course and I have learned so much! The real world projects and tasks throughout the lessons help tremendously with the visual/hands-on learning person that I am. The tutors and project reviewers are great at giving you additional resources if needed and explaining how to come up with solutions rather than just giving you an answer. There are some hard deadlines that keep you going, but it is mostly work at your own pace. I am currently almost 80% complete with the Data Science course and I am also about two weeks ahead of the projected timeline given. I feel like if I can do this, anyone can!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chandra Fase"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
