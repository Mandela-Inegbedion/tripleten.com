Here&#39;s a comprehensive overview of my experience:Why I Decided to Start Learning Data ScienceI have always been fascinated by the power of data and its ability to transform industries and decision-making processes. My background in business gave me a glimpse into the importance of data-driven decisions, but I felt I lacked the technical skills to truly harness the potential of data science. I wanted to bridge this gap and develop a deep understanding of data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to advance my career and make meaningful contributions to my field.Why I Chose TripleTenChoosing TripleTen for my coding journey was driven by several factors:Comprehensive Curriculum: TripleTen offers a well-structured and comprehensive curriculum that covers all essential aspects of Data Science, from Python programming to advanced machine learning techniques.Interactive Learning Platform: The platform is interactive and user-friendly, making it easy to follow along and stay engaged.Project-Based Learning: The emphasis on real-world projects allows for practical application of theoretical knowledge, which is crucial for mastering data science skills.Supportive Community: The community of learners and mentors at TripleTen is incredibly supportive and always willing to help.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alexis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717617600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am someone who is already in the tech world and have worked as a software developer and product manger. However, I decided I wanted to learn data science as it is an increasingly important and relevant field. A bootcamp made sense as it allowed me to do so while still working on my own projects. After some research I found triple ten.I chose triple ten as the reviews seemed to be quite positive, but what sold me was the money back guarantee which ensures that if you don&#39;t land a job in a relevant field within 180 days of graduating you will get a refund. I tend to split my time on my work and personal projects with triple ten at about 50/50 with 20 hours towards my work and 20 hours towards triple ten which keeps me well within the recommended time frame for the course. The program is well structured and easy easy to grasp and the website is very user friendly. The only issues I have had is that I have found some bugs or small mistakes here and there in the coding portion of the lessons, likely stemming from the fact that a class structure like this means they iterate the material frequently. With that said the support chat on the website as well as the community managers and tutors on the discord channel are quick to respond and help out whenever needed.I am about a third of the way through and so far I would recommend it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anna Vasileva&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717617600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/666221cb73fcffaf62e2c2de/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I chose TripleTen because I could study part-time as I&#39;m having a full-time job which was one of the crucial points for me. Another big one was the externship they offer. I didn&#39;t see other bootcamps providing this valuable opportunity. I&#39;m still in the middle of the program but so far I can tell that I&#39;m very happy with my experience. The biggest shout out to success managers and tutors. Tutors are doing an amazing job over there and make sure you really understand things. You can book 1:1 in case you need some personalized help. I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that&#39;s how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven&#39;t started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I&#39;m impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part. All in all, I think it&#39;s a great program and the price is really good for all the things you&#39;re getting from it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Julia Dillon&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717704000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69779#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;A few years ago, I wanted to move away from retail and find something that I could enjoy doing while also an increase in income. I had been in retail for many years and wanted to pivot into another field. I have always been enjoyed Information Technology and thought it would be a great time to make the switch. I had completed a bootcamp previously and had issues with finding employment upon completion. I was on the look out for online bootcamps that actually helped you to find a job after completing the program. While scrolling on Instagram I saw an ad for TripleTen. I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don&#39;t start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sebastian Carter&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717963200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69867#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn&#39;t just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate. Before I join TripleTen I searched very heavily in order to find any kind or form of a red flag that would dissuade me from joing the program, but truthfully I had serious difficulties finding any kind of complaint beyond those who simply wanted a job handed to them. TripleTen is an amazing program that get you actually ready for the workforce, and it properly prepares you for what you should expect from a real job; which unfortunately includes a lot of effort and the willingness to grow and learn new things for yourself. If you are at all considering joining TripleTen I would highly recommend it, just remember that they won&#39;t hand you the answers, you still have to put in the effort to be better and every tutor and instructor I&#39;ve personally talked to truly wished to help you achieve as much as you possibly can.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Hiba A.&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718049600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69877#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have been in my current career field for the better half of my adult life and I was fortunate enough to make the right moves to get to a point where now I make good money for it but I know that if anything happens especially in this economy my current position in a new company would not pay as much. I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn&#39;t overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn&#39;t know and challenged me.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Manuel David Calderon Garcia&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718049600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86031155?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69880#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I&#39;ve always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but was always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I&#39;m in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don&#39;t let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Shawn Dishman&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718136000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6669dd7d241bd98ffd5152fe/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What makes TripleTen so great? In my experience, TripleTen is more than just a coding bootcamp. It&#39;s a community where I receive one-on-one feedback and tutoring from professional software developers. They guide me on what I&#39;m doing right and where I can improve, all while keeping best practices in mind.Being surrounded by like-minded individuals makes it easy to form study groups, push each other to succeed, and share ways to learn and retain information. Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn&#39;t know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I&#39;m currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I&#39;ve learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let&#39;s talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don&#39;t have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you&#39;re considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose?&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;ryley johnson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718654400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/66724bfc35b5f1256fd6cb0d/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated.

They also have tutors who work around the clock that are available for video chat sessions. And what looks like a promising career acceleration program.The only thing is I wish the externships would be guaranteed to the top students because it seems like the most useful item to polish off your portfolio after learning the course.I highly recommend this course, I am learning a lot and as much as I want a job in the field, I am happy that this bootcamp promises money back if I don&#39;t find one within 6 months It&#39;s self paced&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Karinne Hannah&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718827200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70135#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I got an advertisement for TripleTen on my computer at an opportune time in my life, I had just been fired from my job and I had no income I had just completed my UX Design course on Coursera but wasn&#39;t getting any interviews or phone calls based off of the portfolio I provided. When I got an ad for TripleTen&#39;s bootcamp I thought that I could beef up my software engineering skills and taken more seriously as a designer because with this bootcamp I could make a product start to finish from designing it to programming it to testing it (TripleTen giving me the skills to program). The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn&#39;t know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn&#39;t just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn&#39;t get with a normal bootcamp that doesn&#39;t have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It&#39;s a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There&#39;s a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you&#39;re new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one.

I tend to split my time on my work and personal projects with triple ten at about 50/50 with 20 hours towards my work and 20 hours towards triple ten which keeps me well within the recommended time frame for the course. The program is well structured and easy easy to grasp and the website is very user friendly. The only issues I have had is that I have found some bugs or small mistakes here and there in the coding portion of the lessons, likely stemming from the fact that a class structure like this means they iterate the material frequently. With that said the support chat on the website as well as the community managers and tutors on the discord channel are quick to respond and help out whenever needed.I am about a third of the way through and so far I would recommend it. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/666221cb73fcffaf62e2c2de/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anna Vasileva</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose TripleTen because I could study part-time as I&#39;m having a full-time job which was one of the crucial points for me.

The biggest shout out to success managers and tutors. Tutors are doing an amazing job over there and make sure you really understand things. You can book 1:1 in case you need some personalized help. I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that&#39;s how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven&#39;t started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I&#39;m impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part.

I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don&#39;t start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69779#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sebastian Carter</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn&#39;t just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate.

I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn&#39;t overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn&#39;t know and challenged me. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69877#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86031155?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Manuel David Calderon Garcia</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I&#39;ve always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but wa... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>s always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I&#39;m in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don&#39;t let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69880#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/6669dd7d241bd98ffd5152fe/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Shawn Dishman</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>What makes TripleTen so great?

Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn&#39;t know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I&#39;m currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I&#39;ve learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let&#39;s talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don&#39;t have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you&#39;re considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose? </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/66724bfc35b5f1256fd6cb0d/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>ryley johnson</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated.

The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn&#39;t know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn&#39;t just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn&#39;t get with a normal bootcamp that doesn&#39;t have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It&#39;s a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There&#39;s a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you&#39;re new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one.

Here's a comprehensive overview of my experience:Why I Decided to Start Learning Data ScienceI have always been fascinated by the power of data and its ability to transform industries and decision-making processes. My background in business gave me a glimpse into the importance of data-driven decisions, but I felt I lacked the technical skills to truly harness the potential of data science. I wanted to bridge this gap and develop a deep understanding of data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to advance my career and make meaningful contributions to my field.Why I Chose TripleTenChoosing TripleTen for my coding journey was driven by several factors:Comprehensive Curriculum: TripleTen offers a well-structured and comprehensive curriculum that covers all essential aspects of Data Science, from Python programming to advanced machine learning techniques.Interactive Learning Platform: The platform is interactive and user-friendly, making it easy to follow along and stay engaged.Project-Based Learning: The emphasis on real-world projects allows for practical application of theoretical knowledge, which is crucial for mastering data science skills.Supportive Community: The community of learners and mentors at TripleTen is incredibly supportive and always willing to help.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carlos Quintero"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-05T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am someone who is already in the tech world and have worked as a software developer and product manger. However, I decided I wanted to learn data science as it is an increasingly important and relevant field. A bootcamp made sense as it allowed me to do so while still working on my own projects. After some research I found triple ten.I chose triple ten as the reviews seemed to be quite positive, but what sold me was the money back guarantee which ensures that if you don't land a job in a relevant field within 180 days of graduating you will get a refund. I tend to split my time on my work and personal projects with triple ten at about 50/50 with 20 hours towards my work and 20 hours towards triple ten which keeps me well within the recommended time frame for the course. The program is well structured and easy easy to grasp and the website is very user friendly. The only issues I have had is that I have found some bugs or small mistakes here and there in the coding portion of the lessons, likely stemming from the fact that a class structure like this means they iterate the material frequently. With that said the support chat on the website as well as the community managers and tutors on the discord channel are quick to respond and help out whenever needed.I am about a third of the way through and so far I would recommend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexis"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-05T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I chose TripleTen because I could study part-time as I'm having a full-time job which was one of the crucial points for me. Another big one was the externship they offer. I didn't see other bootcamps providing this valuable opportunity. I'm still in the middle of the program but so far I can tell that I'm very happy with my experience. The biggest shout out to success managers and tutors. Tutors are doing an amazing job over there and make sure you really understand things. You can book 1:1 in case you need some personalized help. I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that's how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven't started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I'm impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part. All in all, I think it's a great program and the price is really good for all the things you're getting from it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anna Vasileva"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"A few years ago, I wanted to move away from retail and find something that I could enjoy doing while also an increase in income. I had been in retail for many years and wanted to pivot into another field. I have always been enjoyed Information Technology and thought it would be a great time to make the switch. I had completed a bootcamp previously and had issues with finding employment upon completion. I was on the look out for online bootcamps that actually helped you to find a job after completing the program. While scrolling on Instagram I saw an ad for TripleTen. I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don't start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julia Dillon"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn't just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate. Before I join TripleTen I searched very heavily in order to find any kind or form of a red flag that would dissuade me from joing the program, but truthfully I had serious difficulties finding any kind of complaint beyond those who simply wanted a job handed to them. TripleTen is an amazing program that get you actually ready for the workforce, and it properly prepares you for what you should expect from a real job; which unfortunately includes a lot of effort and the willingness to grow and learn new things for yourself. If you are at all considering joining TripleTen I would highly recommend it, just remember that they won't hand you the answers, you still have to put in the effort to be better and every tutor and instructor I've personally talked to truly wished to help you achieve as much as you possibly can.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sebastian Carter"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have been in my current career field for the better half of my adult life and I was fortunate enough to make the right moves to get to a point where now I make good money for it but I know that if anything happens especially in this economy my current position in a new company would not pay as much. I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn't overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn't know and challenged me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hiba A."},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I've always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but was always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I'm in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don't let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Manuel David Calderon Garcia"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"What makes TripleTen so great? In my experience, TripleTen is more than just a coding bootcamp. It's a community where I receive one-on-one feedback and tutoring from professional software developers. They guide me on what I'm doing right and where I can improve, all while keeping best practices in mind.Being surrounded by like-minded individuals makes it easy to form study groups, push each other to succeed, and share ways to learn and retain information. Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn't know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I'm currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I've learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let's talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don't have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you're considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don't get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shawn Dishman"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated.

When I got an ad for TripleTen's bootcamp I thought that I could beef up my software engineering skills and taken more seriously as a designer because with this bootcamp I could make a product start to finish from designing it to programming it to testing it (TripleTen giving me the skills to program). The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn't know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn't just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn't get with a normal bootcamp that doesn't have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It's a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There's a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you're new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one. I am always happy to answer any questions on Instagram or if you just want to chat https://www.instagram.com/karinnehannah/ or on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinne-hannah-359a1020a/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karinne Hannah"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
