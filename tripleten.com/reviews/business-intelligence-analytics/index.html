Having an industry experience in developing frontend of software applications, I wanted to venture into User Experience Design through a certification program from a reputed community college after my career gap. Although the certification helped me enhance my skillset as a professional, it lacked in a lot of areas like gaining real world project experience, learning how to network, connect with recruiters to mention a few. I stumbled upon TripleTen’s BIA bootcamp through an acquaintance of mine and it seemed like an organic choice for me, with the right amount of technical and design experience in my pocket, to dive into the data/business aspect.  BIA program comprises of subjects like advanced spreadsheets, sql concepts, business analytics, exploring visualization tools like tableau and power bi. The newly gained skills together with transferable skills from my earlier education, made the whole experience worthwhile and a fascinating one. One of the most distinguishing and top-notch aspects about the program is that it is online with an ever-supporting community of tutors, mentors and students bringing out the best in each one. The study material is divided into sprints to mimic the real-world work system with project at end of each sprint providing a complete understanding of the concepts. In addition to the material, there are numerous workshops, online co working sessions, q &amp; a sessions throughout the week to keep the momentum going, learn outside of the intended course material, dive deep into concepts through workshops etc. The programs have been designed beautifully to support working (PT/FT) and non-working professionals alike; with 10-20 hours per week of commitment to gain and excel in new skills which makes it sustainable and fun. Another unique feature of the program is what is called the career acceleration program that gives you tremendous opportunities to be more job ready than ever before by focusing on the right tools (resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, GitHub) and strategies for job search. The program has up-skilled me in ways I couldn’t have imagined, and I have been able to fulfill my strong desire to always delve into the business side of a service/product. I would highly recommend TripleTen program to any individual trying to make it to the tech industry or someone trying to pivot to a new role or even just wanting to have fun exploring new technologies and opportunities it provides. Dream big and make it happen with TripleTen by your side!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ronald McGrath&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712952000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68449#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,51],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen is a coding boot camp with multiple programs to choose from. I started back on February 2, 2024. I&#39;m 21 and I had no clue what I wanted to do. My life consisted of (before doing this boot camp) waking up, going to the gym, going to work, and then playing games. I hated how little money I was making and I was doing absolutely nothing about it. Wasn&#39;t going to school, wasn&#39;t applying to any jobs, and I genuinely felt like a bum. I hated how I felt every day knowing I could do even better but I just didn&#39;t know how or what to do. One day I was watching YouTube and I got an AD on this boot camp and I said what the heck, I clicked the AD and it took me to a webinar an hour+ long and I watched the entire thing. I said why not schedule an appointment to talk with someone about it, I&#39;M NOT EVEN GOING TO LIE, I completely dodged the call when I saw it and went on about my day. A month went by, still felt the same way and the AD COMES BACK, so I attended the webinar again and scheduled it again, AND THIS TIME I WENT WITH IT. I spoke with a lady ( Emma Tilley ) amazing lady, really nice and honestly pretty motivating, when I was speaking to her, to go through it. She answered all my questions and concerns and well I began with the boot camp! It&#39;s been a great experience, one thing I will say! Yes, you can learn all this for free if you&#39;re talented enough to teach yourself everything you need to know but I&#39;m glad I went with this company. THE COMMUNITY IS AMAZING! extremely helpful, they have a discord server, and if you have any concerns no matter how big or small they&#39;ll help you they even have an AI working in their servers so you can ask it questions about your codes and it&#39;ll give you extremely helpful advice and if it couldn&#39;t answer your question then their tutors that will AND BY CHANCE your question still isn&#39;t answered, you can ask your success manager who&#39;s main job is TO MAKE SURE YOU GRADUATE AND GET THAT JOB. My success manager is Mina Miric, an amazing person who always checks up on me and sees if I have any concerns. There&#39;s no way you graduate and won&#39;t get a job when you attend this boot camp, they&#39;re spoon-feeding you a job, you just have to do the hard part and eat, but if you can do that you will be glad you did it. It&#39;s nice knowing that everything will be okay. I highly recommend this boot camp, I will always promote this company and will always recommend it to people. There are a lot more benefits to this boot camp but I won&#39;t go into it. If you&#39;re on the fence about it, I&#39;m telling you right now, just do it. I&#39;m doing the BI Analysis program, of course, it&#39;s hard but they make it easy and it&#39;s hard to fail when there are so many people trying to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen! I GENUINELY, STRONGLY FEEL there&#39;s no way you fail when you go with this boot camp, absolutely no way you don&#39;t graduate and get that job. There&#39;s no way at all that someone can fail and if you do, you simply didn&#39;t want it that bad, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheldon Kinsler&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707595200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66822#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As someone who is currently working in sales, I&#39;ve never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an awesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I&#39;ve always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.\nI started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night&#39;s sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I&#39;m a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.\nThe lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you&#39;re doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It&#39;s honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don&#39;t get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it&#39;s so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.\nBuilt into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven&#39;t quite finished yet, I still feel like I&#39;m ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I&#39;m super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It&#39;s super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I&#39;ve been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that&#39;s super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I&#39;m in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you&#39;re definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn&#39;t much you can&#39;t do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It&#39;s definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can&#39;t effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I&#39;m almost through the course and I&#39;m so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tina Loo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707940800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66947#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they&#39;re not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation. Their program is very interactive and intuitive and the tutors are always available on discord should you need any help. They have weekly coworking sessions that you can attend to speak directly with the tutors and go over any questions/concerns you may have. You&#39;re also assigned a success manager at the beginning who&#39;ll be your go-to contact person should you need any assistance. I found their system to be very well organized and never felt like I didn&#39;t know who to reach out to if I needed anything and was able to finish the program 1 month early!I was happy to learn a new skill set and am currently enrolled in their career acceleration program after finishing the course, thus I cannot really review the job assistance part of it yet, but am really looking forward to hopefully landing a new job in a new career field.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alberniz Garcia Minaya&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710360000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67638#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I ran into an Add on IG about 6 - 7 months ago right when I was thinking on doing a career change. What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the program and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn&#39;t get a Job I&#39;d get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn&#39;t find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there&#39;s always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I&#39;m a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, \&quot;Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this\&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don&#39;t know something or are not experts on something doesn&#39;t mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don&#39;t let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don&#39;t be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Heather N Looby Bennett&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience! Not only am I learning about a field I have no experience in, I am gaining confidence in the field and readying myself for the next chapter in my career. I decided to study with Tripleten because it was the first bootcamp I felt excited about. The counselors took time to explain the programs and consult on the best program for me so I am very confident in my decision! I am an older student (almost 50) but the coursework is explained in a way that is perfect for those without much coding experience. I was apprehensive at first but am now confident in my ability to learn coding and analytics. TripleTen has given me the knowledge and confidence to work in the exciting field of data!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jillian Kingsley&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713816000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68733#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m a student in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analysis bootcamp. I chose this bootcamp because of cost, time commitment, and reviews. It has lived up to its reputation thus far and shown itself to be a good investment. The cost is low compared to similar programs from other companies which was a plus for me as I didn’t have a lot of money to spend on upgrading my skills in order hopefully land a better job in the future. The value you get for the money is certainly worth it. The coursework is challenging but always starts you at the most basic level so no matter your experience level with the material you can understand easily. The sprints are well structured for moving students from beginning level to advanced concepts and the projects are well suited to the material covered so the student gets a lot of practice in the newly acquired skills. The BIA program is new so there are a few things in the sprint materials that could use some improvement such as some minor errors and information that better fits other programs in TripleTen rather than being tailored to the BIA student but these are very small complaints. The student success team is an invaluable resource. The tutors are quick to respond to questions. They are very helpful and patient. My student success manager has been seriously supportive and helpful throughout the process, from getting started to getting one on one tutoring to taking a break from the program (I just had a baby and needed time to adjust before finishing my final project and going on to the career coaching portion of the program). He’s always been reachable and responds within 48 hours of me contacting him. The completion time for this program is 4 months and that estimate was just about right for me. I did need to take two extensions during two different sprints in order to finish the work but those were mostly due to outside influences not insufficient time in the program. The time commitment for me varied between 18-25 hours per week. It truly is a part time program which was a major pro for me as I have been working while completing my bootcamp work. All in all, the program has lived up to what other reviewers have said about it. I hope this review is helpful to someone too.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Vanessa Armstead&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713902400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68748#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hi my names Vanessa and I’m currently enrolled in the Business Intelligence Analyst program. I’ll preface this with I have absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in the tech field whatsoever. Honestly I’ve been thinking about transitioning into tech for a career change for the last 4 years (I currently am in the health and wellness industry as a Personal Trainer and an Assisted Stretch Practitioner). I wanted to get into tech because ultimately I want more freedom with my time, I love that BIA roles have a bunch of hybrid and remote work which is super appealing to me. I’ll admit that I was quite nervous about switching careers because I was unsure how well I would do in tech or if it would even suit me. I found TripleTen on a google search and started looking up reviews, and testimonials on Reddit and a few other sites to see what the overall consensus was. As I’m going through the BIA program , I’ve come to understand how honest a lot of those reviews were and I don’t regret taking the dive with them. The course starts off by easing you into it, explaining what this role entails and listing out multiple directions you can go with in terms of jobs / related fields. I love that it helps teach you how to manage your time and create a healthy balance between work / study. Each sprint takes about 2 weeks &amp; it’s self paced (there are deadlines but you can always ask for extensions if needed). As you progress in the sprints , they do become more challenging. You’re given plenty of examples to practice with as well as small chapter tests in order to test your grasp on the material. Each sprint also builds on one another, meaning you’ll be using skills you learned in previous sprints in order to do the current one. The final projects at the end of the sprints actually act as a portfolio of the different types of skills you’ll need in order to do the job. So basically you’re building your resume as you go through the course. As someone with no tech background I can honestly say that this is good for newbies like myself but I can also see how it would be beneficial for those already in the tech field. I say this because the sprints are actually built off what you’ll be doing in the field , so sometimes you’re learning to troubleshoot or get a bit more creative with how you approach problems. I’ve definitely been challenged by some of the material , and anytime I’m stuck I seek out help through the tutors and DOT ( an AI that helps answer questions and gives clarity). As you turn in each sprint you also get detailed feedback from the reviewers (always someone within the tech field who has extensive knowledge/ experience) , which means there’s plenty of opportunities to get help with any areas you may struggle with. Not to mention they have coworking hours (you can study with a Tutor and with other students from your program). The tutors and the Triple Ten staff have all been amazing thus far! My mentor (or coach) does check ins with me to see how things are going and if there’s anything I’m struggling with. They also offer externships, help with resume building and help you figure out what kind of company you would like to work with / work for by finding what aligns with your values. Overall my experience has been very positive and enlightening. As I progress through the course I am getting more and more excited( now don’t get me wrong lol I’ve definitely cried a couple times because I was struggling with the learning curve that comes with something new - but that’s only because I’m used to picking up new skills quickly and with ease… I just have to work a little bit harder some days.) All in all I would recommend this to others, this has been very rewarding for me and I’m glad I took the leap of faith to set myself up for future success.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Will Hollis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717531200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth. After a significant time weighing my options, I chose TripleTen. I found their course engaging and well-structured. I think that they really spell things out for you without holding your hand through it. It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jorge Norena&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719777600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I recently completed the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) bootcamp with TripleTen, and it was an incredible experience. The program equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge essential for the tech industry. Throughout the course, I received unwavering support from my success manager, Roman, and a host of dedicated tutors. The availability of resources was impressive, making the learning process smooth and efficient.One of the standout features of TripleTen is the community. The connections I made with fellow students and tutors through the TripleTen Discord channel were invaluable. Additionally, their career acceleration program provided substantial support as I prepared to transition into the tech industry.The program&#39;s value is undeniable. It&#39;s self-paced, allowing flexibility, and requires a manageable commitment of weekly learning hours to stay on track. Importantly, no prior experience is needed to enroll, making it accessible to anyone eager to dive into the tech world.Overall, I highly recommend TripleTen to anyone looking to break into the tech industry. The combination of comprehensive learning materials, supportive community, and career advancement opportunities makes it an excellent choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-3ulfmqjo&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-3ulfmqjo="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Neetha</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am a recent graduate from the Business Intelligence Analysis (BIA) program at TripleTen and it has honestly been one of the best decisions of my career.

Although the certification helped me enhance my skillset as a professional, it lacked in a lot of areas like gaining real world project experience, learning how to network, connect with recruiters to mention a few. I stumbled upon TripleTen’s BIA bootcamp through an acquaintance of mine and it seemed like an organic choice for me, with the right amount of technical and design experience in my pocket, to dive into the data/business aspect.  BIA program comprises of subjects like advanced spreadsheets, sql concepts, business analytics, exploring visualization tools like tableau and power bi. The newly gained skills together with transferable skills from my earlier education, made the whole experience worthwhile and a fascinating one. One of the most distinguishing and top-notch aspects about the program is that it is online with an ever-supporting community of tutors, mentors and students bringing out the best in each one. The study material is divided into sprints to mimic the real-world work system with project at end of each sprint providing a complete understanding of the concepts. In addition to the material, there are numerous workshops, online co working sessions, q &amp; a sessions throughout the week to keep the momentum going, learn outside of the intended course material, dive deep into concepts through workshops etc. The programs have been designed beautifully to support working (PT/FT) and non-working professionals alike; with 10-20 hours per week of commitment to gain and excel in new skills which makes it sustainable and fun. Another unique feature of the program is what is called the career acceleration program that gives you tremendous opportunities to be more job ready than ever before by focusing on the right tools (resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, GitHub) and strategies for job search. The program has up-skilled me in ways I couldn’t have imagined, and I have been able to fulfill my strong desire to always delve into the business side of a service/product. I would highly recommend TripleTen program to any individual trying to make it to the tech industry or someone trying to pivot to a new role or even just wanting to have fun exploring new technologies and opportunities it provides. Dream big and make it happen with TripleTen by your side! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67251#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Ronald McGrath</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen is a coding boot camp with multiple programs to choose from. I started back on February 2, 2024. I&#39;m 21 and I had no clue what I wanted to do. My life consisted of (before doing this boot camp) waking up, going to the gym, going to work, and then playing games. I hated how little money I w... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>as making and I was doing absolutely nothing about it. Wasn&#39;t going to school, wasn&#39;t applying to any jobs, and I genuinely felt like a bum. I hated how I felt every day knowing I could do even better but I just didn&#39;t know how or what to do. One day I was watching YouTube and I got an AD on this boot camp and I said what the heck, I clicked the AD and it took me to a webinar an hour+ long and I watched the entire thing. I said why not schedule an appointment to talk with someone about it, I&#39;M NOT EVEN GOING TO LIE, I completely dodged the call when I saw it and went on about my day. A month went by, still felt the same way and the AD COMES BACK, so I attended the webinar again and scheduled it again, AND THIS TIME I WENT WITH IT. I spoke with a lady ( Emma Tilley ) amazing lady, really nice and honestly pretty motivating, when I was speaking to her, to go through it. She answered all my questions and concerns and well I began with the boot camp! It&#39;s been a great experience, one thing I will say! Yes, you can learn all this for free if you&#39;re talented enough to teach yourself everything you need to know but I&#39;m glad I went with this company. THE COMMUNITY IS AMAZING! extremely helpful, they have a discord server, and if you have any concerns no matter how big or small they&#39;ll help you they even have an AI working in their servers so you can ask it questions about your codes and it&#39;ll give you extremely helpful advice and if it couldn&#39;t answer your question then their tutors that will AND BY CHANCE your question still isn&#39;t answered, you can ask your success manager who&#39;s main job is TO MAKE SURE YOU GRADUATE AND GET THAT JOB. My success manager is Mina Miric, an amazing person who always checks up on me and sees if I have any concerns. There&#39;s no way you graduate and won&#39;t get a job when you attend this boot camp, they&#39;re spoon-feeding you a job, you just have to do the hard part and eat, but if you can do that you will be glad you did it. It&#39;s nice knowing that everything will be okay. I highly recommend this boot camp, I will always promote this company and will always recommend it to people. There are a lot more benefits to this boot camp but I won&#39;t go into it. If you&#39;re on the fence about it, I&#39;m telling you right now, just do it. I&#39;m doing the BI Analysis program, of course, it&#39;s hard but they make it easy and it&#39;s hard to fail when there are so many people trying to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen! I GENUINELY, STRONGLY FEEL there&#39;s no way you fail when you go with this boot camp, absolutely no way you don&#39;t graduate and get that job. There&#39;s no way at all that someone can fail and if you do, you simply didn&#39;t want it that bad, I&#39;m sorry. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68449#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sheldon Kinsler</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>As someone who is currently working in sales, I&#39;ve never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an a... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>wesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I&#39;ve always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.
I started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night&#39;s sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I&#39;m a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.
The lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you&#39;re doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It&#39;s honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don&#39;t get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it&#39;s so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.
Built into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven&#39;t quite finished yet, I still feel like I&#39;m ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I&#39;m super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It&#39;s super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I&#39;ve been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that&#39;s super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I&#39;m in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you&#39;re definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn&#39;t much you can&#39;t do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It&#39;s definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can&#39;t effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I&#39;m almost through the course and I&#39;m so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66822#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tina Loo</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they&#39;re not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation.

What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the pr... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ogram and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn&#39;t get a Job I&#39;d get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn&#39;t find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there&#39;s always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I&#39;m a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, &quot;Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don&#39;t know something or are not experts on something doesn&#39;t mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don&#39;t let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don&#39;t be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67638#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Heather N Looby Bennett</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience!

The value you get for the money is certainly worth it. The coursework is challenging but always starts you at the most basic level so no matter your experience level with the material you can understand easily. The sprints are well structured for moving students from beginning level to advanced concepts and the projects are well suited to the material covered so the student gets a lot of practice in the newly acquired skills. The BIA program is new so there are a few things in the sprint materials that could use some improvement such as some minor errors and information that better fits other programs in TripleTen rather than being tailored to the BIA student but these are very small complaints. The student success team is an invaluable resource. The tutors are quick to respond to questions. They are very helpful and patient. My student success manager has been seriously supportive and helpful throughout the process, from getting started to getting one on one tutoring to taking a break from the program (I just had a baby and needed time to adjust before finishing my final project and going on to the career coaching portion of the program). He’s always been reachable and responds within 48 hours of me contacting him. The completion time for this program is 4 months and that estimate was just about right for me. I did need to take two extensions during two different sprints in order to finish the work but those were mostly due to outside influences not insufficient time in the program. The time commitment for me varied between 18-25 hours per week. It truly is a part time program which was a major pro for me as I have been working while completing my bootcamp work. All in all, the program has lived up to what other reviewers have said about it. I hope this review is helpful to someone too. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68733#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Vanessa Armstead</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Hi my names Vanessa and I’m currently enrolled in the Business Intelligence Analyst program. I’ll preface this with I have absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in the tech field whatsoever. Honestly I’ve been thinking about transitioning into tech for a career change for the last 4 years (I currently am in the ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>health and wellness industry as a Personal Trainer and an Assisted Stretch Practitioner). I wanted to get into tech because ultimately I want more freedom with my time, I love that BIA roles have a bunch of hybrid and remote work which is super appealing to me. I’ll admit that I was quite nervous about switching careers because I was unsure how well I would do in tech or if it would even suit me. I found TripleTen on a google search and started looking up reviews, and testimonials on Reddit and a few other sites to see what the overall consensus was. As I’m going through the BIA program , I’ve come to understand how honest a lot of those reviews were and I don’t regret taking the dive with them. The course starts off by easing you into it, explaining what this role entails and listing out multiple directions you can go with in terms of jobs / related fields. I love that it helps teach you how to manage your time and create a healthy balance between work / study. Each sprint takes about 2 weeks &amp; it’s self paced (there are deadlines but you can always ask for extensions if needed). As you progress in the sprints , they do become more challenging. You’re given plenty of examples to practice with as well as small chapter tests in order to test your grasp on the material. Each sprint also builds on one another, meaning you’ll be using skills you learned in previous sprints in order to do the current one. The final projects at the end of the sprints actually act as a portfolio of the different types of skills you’ll need in order to do the job. So basically you’re building your resume as you go through the course. As someone with no tech background I can honestly say that this is good for newbies like myself but I can also see how it would be beneficial for those already in the tech field. I say this because the sprints are actually built off what you’ll be doing in the field , so sometimes you’re learning to troubleshoot or get a bit more creative with how you approach problems. I’ve definitely been challenged by some of the material , and anytime I’m stuck I seek out help through the tutors and DOT ( an AI that helps answer questions and gives clarity). As you turn in each sprint you also get detailed feedback from the reviewers (always someone within the tech field who has extensive knowledge/ experience) , which means there’s plenty of opportunities to get help with any areas you may struggle with. Not to mention they have coworking hours (you can study with a Tutor and with other students from your program). The tutors and the Triple Ten staff have all been amazing thus far! My mentor (or coach) does check ins with me to see how things are going and if there’s anything I’m struggling with. They also offer externships, help with resume building and help you figure out what kind of company you would like to work with / work for by finding what aligns with your values. Overall my experience has been very positive and enlightening. As I progress through the course I am getting more and more excited( now don’t get me wrong lol I’ve definitely cried a couple times because I was struggling with the learning curve that comes with something new - but that’s only because I’m used to picking up new skills quickly and with ease… I just have to work a little bit harder some days.) All in all I would recommend this to others, this has been very rewarding for me and I’m glad I took the leap of faith to set myself up for future success. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68748#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Will Hollis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jorge Norena</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I recently completed the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) bootcamp with TripleTen, and it was an incredible experience.

Having an industry experience in developing frontend of software applications, I wanted to venture into User Experience Design through a certification program from a reputed community college after my career gap. Although the certification helped me enhance my skillset as a professional, it lacked in a lot of areas like gaining real world project experience, learning how to network, connect with recruiters to mention a few. I stumbled upon TripleTen’s BIA bootcamp through an acquaintance of mine and it seemed like an organic choice for me, with the right amount of technical and design experience in my pocket, to dive into the data/business aspect.  BIA program comprises of subjects like advanced spreadsheets, sql concepts, business analytics, exploring visualization tools like tableau and power bi. The newly gained skills together with transferable skills from my earlier education, made the whole experience worthwhile and a fascinating one. One of the most distinguishing and top-notch aspects about the program is that it is online with an ever-supporting community of tutors, mentors and students bringing out the best in each one. The study material is divided into sprints to mimic the real-world work system with project at end of each sprint providing a complete understanding of the concepts. In addition to the material, there are numerous workshops, online co working sessions, q & a sessions throughout the week to keep the momentum going, learn outside of the intended course material, dive deep into concepts through workshops etc. The programs have been designed beautifully to support working (PT/FT) and non-working professionals alike; with 10-20 hours per week of commitment to gain and excel in new skills which makes it sustainable and fun. Another unique feature of the program is what is called the career acceleration program that gives you tremendous opportunities to be more job ready than ever before by focusing on the right tools (resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, GitHub) and strategies for job search. The program has up-skilled me in ways I couldn’t have imagined, and I have been able to fulfill my strong desire to always delve into the business side of a service/product. I would highly recommend TripleTen program to any individual trying to make it to the tech industry or someone trying to pivot to a new role or even just wanting to have fun exploring new technologies and opportunities it provides. Dream big and make it happen with TripleTen by your side!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Neetha"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen is a coding boot camp with multiple programs to choose from. I started back on February 2, 2024. I'm 21 and I had no clue what I wanted to do. My life consisted of (before doing this boot camp) waking up, going to the gym, going to work, and then playing games. I hated how little money I was making and I was doing absolutely nothing about it. Wasn't going to school, wasn't applying to any jobs, and I genuinely felt like a bum. I hated how I felt every day knowing I could do even better but I just didn't know how or what to do. One day I was watching YouTube and I got an AD on this boot camp and I said what the heck, I clicked the AD and it took me to a webinar an hour+ long and I watched the entire thing. I said why not schedule an appointment to talk with someone about it, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO LIE, I completely dodged the call when I saw it and went on about my day. A month went by, still felt the same way and the AD COMES BACK, so I attended the webinar again and scheduled it again, AND THIS TIME I WENT WITH IT. I spoke with a lady ( Emma Tilley ) amazing lady, really nice and honestly pretty motivating, when I was speaking to her, to go through it. She answered all my questions and concerns and well I began with the boot camp! It's been a great experience, one thing I will say! Yes, you can learn all this for free if you're talented enough to teach yourself everything you need to know but I'm glad I went with this company. THE COMMUNITY IS AMAZING! extremely helpful, they have a discord server, and if you have any concerns no matter how big or small they'll help you they even have an AI working in their servers so you can ask it questions about your codes and it'll give you extremely helpful advice and if it couldn't answer your question then their tutors that will AND BY CHANCE your question still isn't answered, you can ask your success manager who's main job is TO MAKE SURE YOU GRADUATE AND GET THAT JOB. My success manager is Mina Miric, an amazing person who always checks up on me and sees if I have any concerns. There's no way you graduate and won't get a job when you attend this boot camp, they're spoon-feeding you a job, you just have to do the hard part and eat, but if you can do that you will be glad you did it. It's nice knowing that everything will be okay. I highly recommend this boot camp, I will always promote this company and will always recommend it to people. There are a lot more benefits to this boot camp but I won't go into it. If you're on the fence about it, I'm telling you right now, just do it. I'm doing the BI Analysis program, of course, it's hard but they make it easy and it's hard to fail when there are so many people trying to make sure that doesn't happen! I GENUINELY, STRONGLY FEEL there's no way you fail when you go with this boot camp, absolutely no way you don't graduate and get that job. There's no way at all that someone can fail and if you do, you simply didn't want it that bad, I'm sorry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ronald McGrath"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As someone who is currently working in sales, I've never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an awesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I've always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.\nI started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night's sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I'm a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.\nThe lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you're doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It's honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don't get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it's so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.\nBuilt into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven't quite finished yet, I still feel like I'm ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I'm super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It's super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I've been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that's super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I'm in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you're definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn't much you can't do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It's definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can't effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I'm almost through the course and I'm so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sheldon Kinsler"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they're not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation. Their program is very interactive and intuitive and the tutors are always available on discord should you need any help. They have weekly coworking sessions that you can attend to speak directly with the tutors and go over any questions/concerns you may have. You're also assigned a success manager at the beginning who'll be your go-to contact person should you need any assistance. I found their system to be very well organized and never felt like I didn't know who to reach out to if I needed anything and was able to finish the program 1 month early!I was happy to learn a new skill set and am currently enrolled in their career acceleration program after finishing the course, thus I cannot really review the job assistance part of it yet, but am really looking forward to hopefully landing a new job in a new career field.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tina Loo"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-13T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I ran into an Add on IG about 6 - 7 months ago right when I was thinking on doing a career change. What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the program and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn't get a Job I'd get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn't find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there's always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I'm a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, \"Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this\". It doesn't matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don't know something or are not experts on something doesn't mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don't let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don't be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alberniz Garcia Minaya"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience!

The counselors took time to explain the programs and consult on the best program for me so I am very confident in my decision! I am an older student (almost 50) but the coursework is explained in a way that is perfect for those without much coding experience.

I chose this bootcamp because of cost, time commitment, and reviews. It has lived up to its reputation thus far and shown itself to be a good investment. The cost is low compared to similar programs from other companies which was a plus for me as I didn’t have a lot of money to spend on upgrading my skills in order hopefully land a better job in the future. The value you get for the money is certainly worth it. The coursework is challenging but always starts you at the most basic level so no matter your experience level with the material you can understand easily. The sprints are well structured for moving students from beginning level to advanced concepts and the projects are well suited to the material covered so the student gets a lot of practice in the newly acquired skills. The BIA program is new so there are a few things in the sprint materials that could use some improvement such as some minor errors and information that better fits other programs in TripleTen rather than being tailored to the BIA student but these are very small complaints. The student success team is an invaluable resource. The tutors are quick to respond to questions. They are very helpful and patient. My student success manager has been seriously supportive and helpful throughout the process, from getting started to getting one on one tutoring to taking a break from the program (I just had a baby and needed time to adjust before finishing my final project and going on to the career coaching portion of the program). He’s always been reachable and responds within 48 hours of me contacting him. The completion time for this program is 4 months and that estimate was just about right for me. I did need to take two extensions during two different sprints in order to finish the work but those were mostly due to outside influences not insufficient time in the program. The time commitment for me varied between 18-25 hours per week. It truly is a part time program which was a major pro for me as I have been working while completing my bootcamp work. All in all, the program has lived up to what other reviewers have said about it. I hope this review is helpful to someone too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jillian Kingsley"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-23T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Hi my names Vanessa and I’m currently enrolled in the Business Intelligence Analyst program. I’ll preface this with I have absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in the tech field whatsoever. Honestly I’ve been thinking about transitioning into tech for a career change for the last 4 years (I currently am in the health and wellness industry as a Personal Trainer and an Assisted Stretch Practitioner). I wanted to get into tech because ultimately I want more freedom with my time, I love that BIA roles have a bunch of hybrid and remote work which is super appealing to me. I’ll admit that I was quite nervous about switching careers because I was unsure how well I would do in tech or if it would even suit me. I found TripleTen on a google search and started looking up reviews, and testimonials on Reddit and a few other sites to see what the overall consensus was. As I’m going through the BIA program , I’ve come to understand how honest a lot of those reviews were and I don’t regret taking the dive with them. The course starts off by easing you into it, explaining what this role entails and listing out multiple directions you can go with in terms of jobs / related fields. I love that it helps teach you how to manage your time and create a healthy balance between work / study. Each sprint takes about 2 weeks & it’s self paced (there are deadlines but you can always ask for extensions if needed). As you progress in the sprints , they do become more challenging. You’re given plenty of examples to practice with as well as small chapter tests in order to test your grasp on the material. Each sprint also builds on one another, meaning you’ll be using skills you learned in previous sprints in order to do the current one. The final projects at the end of the sprints actually act as a portfolio of the different types of skills you’ll need in order to do the job. So basically you’re building your resume as you go through the course. As someone with no tech background I can honestly say that this is good for newbies like myself but I can also see how it would be beneficial for those already in the tech field. I say this because the sprints are actually built off what you’ll be doing in the field , so sometimes you’re learning to troubleshoot or get a bit more creative with how you approach problems. I’ve definitely been challenged by some of the material , and anytime I’m stuck I seek out help through the tutors and DOT ( an AI that helps answer questions and gives clarity). As you turn in each sprint you also get detailed feedback from the reviewers (always someone within the tech field who has extensive knowledge/ experience) , which means there’s plenty of opportunities to get help with any areas you may struggle with. Not to mention they have coworking hours (you can study with a Tutor and with other students from your program). The tutors and the Triple Ten staff have all been amazing thus far! My mentor (or coach) does check ins with me to see how things are going and if there’s anything I’m struggling with. They also offer externships, help with resume building and help you figure out what kind of company you would like to work with / work for by finding what aligns with your values. Overall my experience has been very positive and enlightening. As I progress through the course I am getting more and more excited( now don’t get me wrong lol I’ve definitely cried a couple times because I was struggling with the learning curve that comes with something new - but that’s only because I’m used to picking up new skills quickly and with ease… I just have to work a little bit harder some days.) All in all I would recommend this to others, this has been very rewarding for me and I’m glad I took the leap of faith to set myself up for future success.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vanessa Armstead"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-04T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth. After a significant time weighing my options, I chose TripleTen. I found their course engaging and well-structured. I think that they really spell things out for you without holding your hand through it. It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Will Hollis"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I recently completed the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) bootcamp with TripleTen, and it was an incredible experience. The program equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge essential for the tech industry. Throughout the course, I received unwavering support from my success manager, Roman, and a host of dedicated tutors. The availability of resources was impressive, making the learning process smooth and efficient.One of the standout features of TripleTen is the community. The connections I made with fellow students and tutors through the TripleTen Discord channel were invaluable. Additionally, their career acceleration program provided substantial support as I prepared to transition into the tech industry.The program's value is undeniable. It's self-paced, allowing flexibility, and requires a manageable commitment of weekly learning hours to stay on track. Importantly, no prior experience is needed to enroll, making it accessible to anyone eager to dive into the tech world.Overall, I highly recommend TripleTen to anyone looking to break into the tech industry. The combination of comprehensive learning materials, supportive community, and career advancement opportunities makes it an excellent choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jorge Norena"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-3ulfmqjo="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
