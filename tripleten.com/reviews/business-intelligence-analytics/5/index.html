While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn&#39;t see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn&#39;t sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen&#39;s website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program&#39;s commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.\nI can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I&#39;ve been fully supported in the process. When I&#39;m working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer&#39;s feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I&#39;d say run, don&#39;t walk! I wholeheartedly recommend taking the leap. Just be aware, it&#39;s essential to approach this journey with a growth-mindset, as the work is no cake walk. Embracing challenges is the mechanism to personal and professional growth in any field. I found that to be true in Fashion, Social Work, and now the vast world of Data!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy Maldonado&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67768#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I researched a variety of bootcamps looking for one that would give me the better bang for my buck. Let&#39;s be real, it&#39;s hard out there. It is definitely worth it. At first, it was rough, especially since I had no background on coding. My success manager made sure to reassure me that there are tools out there for help and pointed me in the right direction. There are tutors to help, fellow students, AI help, all you need is to bring your best intentions to succeed. I use the knowledge base section on the platform a lot to practice my skills. The recommended time per week to invest on your education is at least 10 hours. You can put in more work, if you have the time. I put in about 10-12 and still manage to maintain myself ahead. My only negative comment is that I am a visual learner, and a few of the chapters were harder on me, because I could not visualize the information provided. I do rely more on the workshops and AI to visualize the topics covered, as well as practice AD nauseum. I have learned vital information to my future career as a Business Intelligence Analyst, I have no doubt I made the right choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Mia Wertz&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67752#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Back in December 2023, I decided to leave a job where I was underpaid and over-stressed. I wanted to switch gears, and I wanted to work less on the front end (dealing with customers day in, day out) and work more behind the scenes. As I was looking around online for options, I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into the Business Intelligence Analytics program. Now, I am so thankful that I made the spur-of-the-moment decision to just... start. The courses are challenging enough to be fulfilling but not hard enough to make me want to pull my hair out. When it gets more difficult, there are numerous ways to find support, whether directly from a tutor or going through archived conversations within the community. The content is straightforward, the price is fair, the support staff is kind and knowledgeable, and the career advancement courses help make the job search feel structured and less intimidating. I&#39;m very thankful I found this boot camp. I&#39;m feeling a lot more competent, I have an increased sense of self-efficacy, I&#39;m enjoying learning (I almost always do but this boot camp is easy to enjoy, and I&#39;m making new connections through the community. I&#39;m really looking forward to finding a job in my field and continuing on to the next section of this new chapter in my life!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dino Black&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710964800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67854#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started this program because I have a great passion for technology and storytelling. Being in data-driven environments has become quite a normalcy in my day-to-day work in the automotive industry. So I wanted a change; I wanted to work towards becoming an influencer, an advisor, and a storyteller to help leadership make data-driven decisions that mattered. So here I am, in this amazing bootcamp. Currently, I&#39;m halfway through my business intelligence analytics program, and honestly, it&#39;s a great feeling. The program has been very interactive, filled with great theory and hands-on exercises that ultimately lead to projects. I highly recommend this program if you&#39;re looking for a chance to gain a new skillset and if you&#39;re looking for an opportunity to transition careers into the technology industry. My advice is to show up for yourself and take it one day at a time. Be patient with yourself, ask for help, and don&#39;t get discouraged&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Priyanka Mukherjee&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711828800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68179#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After my MBA, I wanted to learn tech to work from home, especially because I have a baby. I looked at many bootcamps and finally chose TripleTen. I wasn&#39;t sure at first, but after a call with them about how the course works, I was impressed and joined.Now, at the end of the course, I can say TripleTen is great. The teachers are always there to help, there are lots of resources, and they give you demo sheets to practice while learning. I learned a lot and really liked everything about this bootcamp.

I&#39;ve worked in merchandise processing for a about two- three years and also work in data entry for a laboratory and as well some temporary jobs, during this time I&#39;d see my close friends go off and make insane money from becoming software engineers and code writing genius &amp; I always wanted to work in tech but honestly coding didn&#39;t seem to fit me to well. When I took the first test of what program best fits me, I learned about the Business Intelligence Analyst program and what we would be learning and I could honestly say that it was the best fit for me and my situation! They had me go through and talk with one of the representatives &amp; talk about my $$ situation, I had just been laid off from my job and was currently looking for work anywhere and was planning on saving up to pay off in full but the representative had told me about the two installment plans an how i wouldn&#39;t have to pay for anything till TripleTen had found me a job after I graduated! Basically if you qualify for this program TripleTen has six months till after you graduate to help you find a job role that you went to school for and if they aren&#39;t able to you don&#39;t pay anything and you get your money back! That really was the deciding factor for choosing TripleTen schooling, every other bootcamp just wants you to go through their program and leave ya out to dry once your done, Tripleten has their own department dedicated to helping you find a job. The school work couldn&#39;t be better &amp; when I go back to study I always see that they are constantly updating their course work with relevant data and great course direction. I can say that I cannot wait to accomplish all my goals this year and be the best version of myself. If I can learn this I know that anybody with enough dedication can as well. Tripleten turn me into a data driven individual!!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jasmine Hendrix&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712520000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68356#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently about 2 months into the Business Intelligence Analyst program with TripleTen and honestly couldn’t recommend it more. First, the amount of support you receive from the tutors and success coach is phenomenal. I definitely wasn’t expecting the level of involvement that they have with all the students. They’ve set up a wonderful system of resources for the students to use through Discourse, making it easy to get all the help you could possibly need to succeed in the program. Even if you aren’t necessarily wanting to connect to a tutor for everything you have issues with, they have past discussions that have questions other students have asked about how to complete certain tasks in the projects. I love the hands on learning. It’s set up to where you’re able to do/have to do the practice tasks to get hands on experience for each topic so that you don’t feel lost during the project. I have seen some people say it’s a lot of work on top of their jobs and personal lives, but I feel like I’ve been able to get through it fairly quickly without feeling like I’m falling behind. But of course if you do happen to fall behind, they are able to help you get back on track by giving you an extension and providing support if you’re struggling to understand a topic. The course itself is a little expensive, but I feel like if you stick to it and utilize all the resources, it’s well worth the money and time. It was a much better option (time-wise) than trying to go back to school for another degree to advance my career. Overall, I believe this is a great program for anyone wanting to expand their skill set or enter a new career path like me. It’s very user friendly and the amount of support is amazing.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Robert Pickett&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712692800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68413#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen offers remote data analyst training that&#39;s accessible and effective. They can help you prepare for data analytics certification and a career in business intelligence.\nTripleTen stands out because of its focus on community and support.

When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;William Hollis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713124800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68486#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it.

While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn&#39;t see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn&#39;t sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen&#39;s website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program&#39;s commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.
I can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I&#39;ve been fully supported in the process. When I&#39;m working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer&#39;s feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I&#39;d say run, don&#39;t walk! I wholeheartedly recommend taking the leap. Just be aware, it&#39;s essential to approach this journey with a growth-mindset, as the work is no cake walk. Embracing challenges is the mechanism to personal and professional growth in any field. I found that to be true in Fashion, Social Work, and now the vast world of Data! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67639#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Amy Maldonado</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I researched a variety of bootcamps looking for one that would give me the better bang for my buck.

The recommended time per week to invest on your education is at least 10 hours. You can put in more work, if you have the time. I put in about 10-12 and still manage to maintain myself ahead. My only negative comment is that I am a visual learner, and a few of the chapters were harder on me, because I could not visualize the information provided. I do rely more on the workshops and AI to visualize the topics covered, as well as practice AD nauseum.

When I took the first test of what program best fits me, I learned about the Business Intelligence Analyst program and what we would be learning and I could honestly say that it was the best fit for me and my situation! They had me go through and talk with one of the representatives &amp; talk about my $$ situation, I had just been laid off from my job and was currently looking for work anywhere and was planning on saving up to pay off in full but the representative had told me about the two installment plans an how i wouldn&#39;t have to pay for anything till TripleTen had found me a job after I graduated! Basically if you qualify for this program TripleTen has six months till after you graduate to help you find a job role that you went to school for and if they aren&#39;t able to you don&#39;t pay anything and you get your money back! That really was the deciding factor for choosing TripleTen schooling, every other bootcamp just wants you to go through their program and leave ya out to dry once your done, Tripleten has their own department dedicated to helping you find a job. The school work couldn&#39;t be better &amp; when I go back to study I always see that they are constantly updating their course work with relevant data and great course direction. I can say that I cannot wait to accomplish all my goals this year and be the best version of myself. If I can learn this I know that anybody with enough dedication can as well.

First, the amount of support you receive from the tutors and success coach is phenomenal. I definitely wasn’t expecting the level of involvement that they have with al... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>l the students. They’ve set up a wonderful system of resources for the students to use through Discourse, making it easy to get all the help you could possibly need to succeed in the program. Even if you aren’t necessarily wanting to connect to a tutor for everything you have issues with, they have past discussions that have questions other students have asked about how to complete certain tasks in the projects. I love the hands on learning. It’s set up to where you’re able to do/have to do the practice tasks to get hands on experience for each topic so that you don’t feel lost during the project. I have seen some people say it’s a lot of work on top of their jobs and personal lives, but I feel like I’ve been able to get through it fairly quickly without feeling like I’m falling behind. But of course if you do happen to fall behind, they are able to help you get back on track by giving you an extension and providing support if you’re struggling to understand a topic. The course itself is a little expensive, but I feel like if you stick to it and utilize all the resources, it’s well worth the money and time. It was a much better option (time-wise) than trying to go back to school for another degree to advance my career. Overall, I believe this is a great program for anyone wanting to expand their skill set or enter a new career path like me. It’s very user friendly and the amount of support is amazing. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68356#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Robert Pickett</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen offers remote data analyst training that&#39;s accessible and effective. They can help you prepare for data analytics certification and a career in business intelligence.

When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68441#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>William Hollis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn't see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn't sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen's website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program's commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.\nI can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I've been fully supported in the process. When I'm working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer's feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I'd say run, don't walk! I wholeheartedly recommend taking the leap. Just be aware, it's essential to approach this journey with a growth-mindset, as the work is no cake walk. Embracing challenges is the mechanism to personal and professional growth in any field. I found that to be true in Fashion, Social Work, and now the vast world of Data!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sara Kaempf"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I researched a variety of bootcamps looking for one that would give me the better bang for my buck. Let's be real, it's hard out there. It is definitely worth it. At first, it was rough, especially since I had no background on coding. My success manager made sure to reassure me that there are tools out there for help and pointed me in the right direction. There are tutors to help, fellow students, AI help, all you need is to bring your best intentions to succeed. I use the knowledge base section on the platform a lot to practice my skills. The recommended time per week to invest on your education is at least 10 hours. You can put in more work, if you have the time. I put in about 10-12 and still manage to maintain myself ahead. My only negative comment is that I am a visual learner, and a few of the chapters were harder on me, because I could not visualize the information provided. I do rely more on the workshops and AI to visualize the topics covered, as well as practice AD nauseum. I have learned vital information to my future career as a Business Intelligence Analyst, I have no doubt I made the right choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amy Maldonado"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Back in December 2023, I decided to leave a job where I was underpaid and over-stressed. I wanted to switch gears, and I wanted to work less on the front end (dealing with customers day in, day out) and work more behind the scenes. As I was looking around online for options, I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into the Business Intelligence Analytics program. Now, I am so thankful that I made the spur-of-the-moment decision to just... start. The courses are challenging enough to be fulfilling but not hard enough to make me want to pull my hair out. When it gets more difficult, there are numerous ways to find support, whether directly from a tutor or going through archived conversations within the community. The content is straightforward, the price is fair, the support staff is kind and knowledgeable, and the career advancement courses help make the job search feel structured and less intimidating. I'm very thankful I found this boot camp. I'm feeling a lot more competent, I have an increased sense of self-efficacy, I'm enjoying learning (I almost always do but this boot camp is easy to enjoy, and I'm making new connections through the community.

Being in data-driven environments has become quite a normalcy in my day-to-day work in the automotive industry. So I wanted a change; I wanted to work towards becoming an influencer, an advisor, and a storyteller to help leadership make data-driven decisions that mattered. So here I am, in this amazing bootcamp. Currently, I'm halfway through my business intelligence analytics program, and honestly, it's a great feeling. The program has been very interactive, filled with great theory and hands-on exercises that ultimately lead to projects. I highly recommend this program if you're looking for a chance to gain a new skillset and if you're looking for an opportunity to transition careers into the technology industry. My advice is to show up for yourself and take it one day at a time.

I've worked in merchandise processing for a about two- three years and also work in data entry for a laboratory and as well some temporary jobs, during this time I'd see my close friends go off and make insane money from becoming software engineers and code writing genius & I always wanted to work in tech but honestly coding didn't seem to fit me to well. When I took the first test of what program best fits me, I learned about the Business Intelligence Analyst program and what we would be learning and I could honestly say that it was the best fit for me and my situation! They had me go through and talk with one of the representatives & talk about my $$ situation, I had just been laid off from my job and was currently looking for work anywhere and was planning on saving up to pay off in full but the representative had told me about the two installment plans an how i wouldn't have to pay for anything till TripleTen had found me a job after I graduated! Basically if you qualify for this program TripleTen has six months till after you graduate to help you find a job role that you went to school for and if they aren't able to you don't pay anything and you get your money back! That really was the deciding factor for choosing TripleTen schooling, every other bootcamp just wants you to go through their program and leave ya out to dry once your done, Tripleten has their own department dedicated to helping you find a job. The school work couldn't be better & when I go back to study I always see that they are constantly updating their course work with relevant data and great course direction. I can say that I cannot wait to accomplish all my goals this year and be the best version of myself. If I can learn this I know that anybody with enough dedication can as well. Tripleten turn me into a data driven individual!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jason Thomas Schiller"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-07T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am currently about 2 months into the Business Intelligence Analyst program with TripleTen and honestly couldn’t recommend it more. First, the amount of support you receive from the tutors and success coach is phenomenal. I definitely wasn’t expecting the level of involvement that they have with all the students. They’ve set up a wonderful system of resources for the students to use through Discourse, making it easy to get all the help you could possibly need to succeed in the program. Even if you aren’t necessarily wanting to connect to a tutor for everything you have issues with, they have past discussions that have questions other students have asked about how to complete certain tasks in the projects. I love the hands on learning. It’s set up to where you’re able to do/have to do the practice tasks to get hands on experience for each topic so that you don’t feel lost during the project. I have seen some people say it’s a lot of work on top of their jobs and personal lives, but I feel like I’ve been able to get through it fairly quickly without feeling like I’m falling behind. But of course if you do happen to fall behind, they are able to help you get back on track by giving you an extension and providing support if you’re struggling to understand a topic. The course itself is a little expensive, but I feel like if you stick to it and utilize all the resources, it’s well worth the money and time. It was a much better option (time-wise) than trying to go back to school for another degree to advance my career. Overall, I believe this is a great program for anyone wanting to expand their skill set or enter a new career path like me. It’s very user friendly and the amount of support is amazing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jasmine Hendrix"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen offers remote data analyst training that's accessible and effective. They can help you prepare for data analytics certification and a career in business intelligence.\nTripleTen stands out because of its focus on community and support.

When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike Austria"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.
