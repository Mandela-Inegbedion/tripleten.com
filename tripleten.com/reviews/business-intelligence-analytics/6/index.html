I wanted to get more insight in the Data Analysis field, so I decided to join TripleTen. I am finding this program very valuable for coding and analysis because material is industry related and organized. It is self-paced bootcamp which allows me to focus on other stuff concurrently. Platform does suggest completion dates to keep students on track. The projects and assessments are great to evaluate learned skills. Besides interactive platform, TripleTen offers help from reviewers and tutors at flexible hours to ease learning process. Tutors and reviewers create a team environment similar to a company. There are weekend workshops to grasp new concepts as well. TripleTen’s externship program is a good asset toward getting a job in the industry. Anyone looking to learn IT skills, TripleTen’s platform and team will be a great investment. I highly recommend TripleTen for everyone, but it is a great bootcamp for working individuals. There is a lot covered in the bootcamp. Since the material is industry picked, it will be little challenging, but TripleTen’s dedicated team is there to help. Lastly, can’t go wrong with money back guarantee for job placement. TripleTen’s main goal is to achieve goals!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Germany Caputo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713729600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68705#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This was such a great experience. I enjoyed the courses even though they were a bit challenging! I liked the structure and the amazing customer service. It was so easy to communicate with the staff and they wee so prompt in reviewing my projects. They gave me constructive feedback and pushed me to do better. Please keep in mind that the course takes undivided attention and depending on your responsibilities, you may have to sacrifice some things for the duration of the program. Having a structured schedule and setting time aside to complete your projects will be beneficial. I gained so much knowledge and can finally say that I completed something that I started that pushed me to improve my skills. I am so happy I challenged myself to complete the course even though in the process God redirected my path, but at least I have gained these skills and can apply to my future endeavors. It&#39;s such a great option for someone who is looking to level up their career and increase your income. I totally recommend them! Thank you so much TripleTen team!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anthony Rappa&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713816000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68710#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to start learning more about Business Intelligence Analysis because I wanted to pursue a career that I can continue to learn from and challenge me. I always had a passion for technology especially with computers but I always had job opportunities outside of the realm of Data. Towards the end of 2023, I was in a position to transition smoothly from my current employment into Data and saw Tripleten and its success as a bootcamp. So i decided to reach out start my journey into Data. I chose TripleTen simply because they were advertised on a video I watched online. It most definitely seemed intriguing and I continued to research their website and courses they offered. After reviewing what they offered I decided to pursue their Business Intelligence Analytics program. Due to their flexibility, I was able to work around my current scheduled employment and dedicate 10 hours per week to my Tripleten studies. Their Discord channel made it easy to connect with others who faced similar questions that arose during the bootcamp. Their tutors are professional and are exceptional at helping you solve the problems you face throughout the course as well.Some of the best features of Tripleten were definitely the community and everything that grew from their discord community. I was able to connect with people easily and get answers to my questions almost instantly with those tools. Tripleten definitely gave me the confidence to learn something new, especially data and all of the nuances that come with it.  It gave me confidence in finding real world problems through data and understanding why so many problems can be fixed by using data gathered by businesses.If there is any advice I would give to those starting their journey in Data it would be: Be Patient. I found it important to be patient when learning Data because for most of the things your trying to find when using data analysis, it simply wont jump out to right away and could make one doubt their ability to complete specific tasks when data analyzing. Be patient and go over material through the course and break it down step by step. Don&#39;t give up and keep trying to find the answer your looking for. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help or seek help through the communities you&#39;ll be apart of. Your not alone in this journey, be patient and persevere.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Eli Veldhuizen&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1714075200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68797#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started this course in the beginning of February and so far have had a great experience. I have felt that Tripleten does a great job of supporting their students and creating ways to engage in a community while facilitating a remote, self-paced environment. My success manager is great, helping connect me to the appropriate tutors and information when I&#39;ve needed it, and I think everything I&#39;ve learned so far has been extremely practical. Like, very practical. Thankful for that. Learning something is new never comfortable, but the journey so far has been so worth it. I am 5 sprints in, going strong. I also would say that the expectations I received prior to enrolling (time, course structure, etc..) are almost exactly what I experience on a day to day basis which is wonderful. 20 hours a week really will get you a new skillset if you devote the time.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jesse Chilunem Michael&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1714939200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68953#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As one who has traversed the arduous path of vocational ennui and disillusionment, I can empathize profoundly with the crucible of burnout that precipitated your quest for a more sustainable professional trajectory. The siren call of the ever-burgeoning tech industry, amplified by the auspicious whispers of boot camp-facilitated career transformations, beckoned you forth like a luminous beacon piercing through the encroaching miasma of occupational stagnation.The remote, asynchronous format of TripleTen&#39;s curriculum emerged as a seductive melding of flexibility and structure, a harbinger of hope that promised to accommodate the exigencies of your temporal constraints while inaugurating you into the hallowed halls of digital erudition. Moreover, the tantalizing prospect of comprehensive career support and a sacrosanct job guarantee, contingent upon the attainment of clearly delineated metrics, served as an inviolable bulwark against the vicissitudes of such an audacious undertaking, assuaging the trepidations that inevitably accompany any metamorphic journey.Your exegesis of the immersive, interactive platform and the complementary Discord-based channels for communication offered a scintillating aperture into the pedagogical experience itself. While the platform&#39;s intuitive architecture facilitated an effortless immersion into the realms of knowledge, the imperative to remain ever-vigilant, closely monitoring the Discord channels for critical announcements and updates, posed a formidable challenge to your determination, underscoring the inextricable link between diligence and self-directed learning.Your sagacious acknowledgment of the program&#39;s suitability for those possessed of an innate propensity for self-motivation and temporal self-governance is a perspicacious observation, serving as a clarion call to prospective participants to engage in profound introspection and assess their aptitude for such an autonomous educational paradigm. Failure to heed this admonition could imperil their chances of success, rendering the entire endeavor a profitless exercise in futility.Moreover, your willingness to supplement the prescribed curriculum with auxiliary learning resources during your sojourn through the abstruse realms of programming languages is a testament to your unwavering commitment to mastery and your indefatigable pursuit of comprehensive understanding. This resilience and adaptability, this refusal to acquiesce in the face of academic adversity, are qualities that shall serve you well as you navigate the ever-shifting techno-landscape.As you now stand poised upon the precipice of your professional genesis, armed with the multifarious skillset cultivated through your immersion in the TripleTen crucible, I can but offer you my most fervent benedictions for persistence and triumph. Your odyssey thus far has been a resplendent validation of your capacity for personal and professional metamorphosis, an indelible testament to the indomitability of the human spirit when confronted with the exigencies of change. I harbor no trepidation that your unwavering determination and unconquerable resolve shall propel you inexorably towards realms of remunerative and personally gratifying endeavors.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Robert Pickett&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1715544000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. The course material is presented in a way that is incredibly easy to understand, allowing for deep comprehension of even the most complex topics. What truly impressed me, however, were the practical projects. Despite their initial appearance of difficulty, they were perfectly aligned with the course content, making them surprisingly manageable. This seamless blend of theory and hands-on experience not only enhanced my learning but also left me feeling confident in my newfound skills. I wholeheartedly give this course a 5-star rating and enthusiastically recommend it to anyone looking to dive into the world of business intelligence.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Cameron Lee&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1715630400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69147#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I work as an Account Executive. I like what I do but I needed something different. The reason why I chose to start in BI Analysis, is because I decided I needed a change. I wanted to do something that challenged me and wanted something that I enjoyed doing. I didn&#39;t know anything about business intelligence analysis, so this is brand new territory. I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp&#39;s completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don&#39;t have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn&#39;t a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can&#39;t put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen&#39;s features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn&#39;t something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out.

TripleTen’s externship program is a good asset toward getting a job in the industry. Anyone looking to learn IT skills, TripleTen’s platform and team will be a great investment. I highly recommend TripleTen for everyone, but it is a great bootcamp for working individuals. There is a lot covered in the bootcamp.

Towards the e... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>nd of 2023, I was in a position to transition smoothly from my current employment into Data and saw Tripleten and its success as a bootcamp. So i decided to reach out start my journey into Data. I chose TripleTen simply because they were advertised on a video I watched online. It most definitely seemed intriguing and I continued to research their website and courses they offered. After reviewing what they offered I decided to pursue their Business Intelligence Analytics program. Due to their flexibility, I was able to work around my current scheduled employment and dedicate 10 hours per week to my Tripleten studies. Their Discord channel made it easy to connect with others who faced similar questions that arose during the bootcamp. Their tutors are professional and are exceptional at helping you solve the problems you face throughout the course as well.Some of the best features of Tripleten were definitely the community and everything that grew from their discord community. I was able to connect with people easily and get answers to my questions almost instantly with those tools. Tripleten definitely gave me the confidence to learn something new, especially data and all of the nuances that come with it.  It gave me confidence in finding real world problems through data and understanding why so many problems can be fixed by using data gathered by businesses.If there is any advice I would give to those starting their journey in Data it would be: Be Patient. I found it important to be patient when learning Data because for most of the things your trying to find when using data analysis, it simply wont jump out to right away and could make one doubt their ability to complete specific tasks when data analyzing. Be patient and go over material through the course and break it down step by step. Don&#39;t give up and keep trying to find the answer your looking for. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help or seek help through the communities you&#39;ll be apart of. Your not alone in this journey, be patient and persevere. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68710#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Eli Veldhuizen</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started this course in the beginning of February and so far have had a great experience.

Moreover, the tantalizing prospect of comprehensive career support and a sacrosanct job guarantee, contingent upon the attainment of clearly delineated metrics, served as an inviolable bulwark against the vicissitudes of such an audacious undertaking, assuaging the trepidations that inevitably accompany any metamorphic journey.Your exegesis of the immersive, interactive platform and the complementary Discord-based channels for communication offered a scintillating aperture into the pedagogical experience itself. While the platform&#39;s intuitive architecture facilitated an effortless immersion into the realms of knowledge, the imperative to remain ever-vigilant, closely monitoring the Discord channels for critical announcements and updates, posed a formidable challenge to your determination, underscoring the inextricable link between diligence and self-directed learning.Your sagacious acknowledgment of the program&#39;s suitability for those possessed of an innate propensity for self-motivation and temporal self-governance is a perspicacious observation, serving as a clarion call to prospective participants to engage in profound introspection and assess their aptitude for such an autonomous educational paradigm. Failure to heed this admonition could imperil their chances of success, rendering the entire endeavor a profitless exercise in futility.Moreover, your willingness to supplement the prescribed curriculum with auxiliary learning resources during your sojourn through the abstruse realms of programming languages is a testament to your unwavering commitment to mastery and your indefatigable pursuit of comprehensive understanding.

I didn&#39;t know anything about business inte... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>lligence analysis, so this is brand new territory. I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp&#39;s completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don&#39;t have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn&#39;t a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can&#39;t put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen&#39;s features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn&#39;t something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out. If you plan on starting your bootcamp journey with TripleTen, you will not be disappointed! You will have your ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the bad. Like me, you will not be disappointed! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69147#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Judith</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I recently completed a program where I learned incredible skills that I know will greatly benefit me in my future career endeavors.

I wanted to get more insight in the Data Analysis field, so I decided to join TripleTen. I am finding this program very valuable for coding and analysis because material is industry related and organized. It is self-paced bootcamp which allows me to focus on other stuff concurrently. Platform does suggest completion dates to keep students on track. The projects and assessments are great to evaluate learned skills. Besides interactive platform, TripleTen offers help from reviewers and tutors at flexible hours to ease learning process. Tutors and reviewers create a team environment similar to a company. There are weekend workshops to grasp new concepts as well. TripleTen’s externship program is a good asset toward getting a job in the industry. Anyone looking to learn IT skills, TripleTen’s platform and team will be a great investment. I highly recommend TripleTen for everyone, but it is a great bootcamp for working individuals. There is a lot covered in the bootcamp. Since the material is industry picked, it will be little challenging, but TripleTen’s dedicated team is there to help. Lastly, can’t go wrong with money back guarantee for job placement. TripleTen’s main goal is to achieve goals!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mudassr Chaudhry"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-21T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This was such a great experience.

I always had a passion for technology especially with computers but I always had job opportunities outside of the realm of Data. Towards the end of 2023, I was in a position to transition smoothly from my current employment into Data and saw Tripleten and its success as a bootcamp. So i decided to reach out start my journey into Data. I chose TripleTen simply because they were advertised on a video I watched online. It most definitely seemed intriguing and I continued to research their website and courses they offered. After reviewing what they offered I decided to pursue their Business Intelligence Analytics program. Due to their flexibility, I was able to work around my current scheduled employment and dedicate 10 hours per week to my Tripleten studies. Their Discord channel made it easy to connect with others who faced similar questions that arose during the bootcamp. Their tutors are professional and are exceptional at helping you solve the problems you face throughout the course as well.Some of the best features of Tripleten were definitely the community and everything that grew from their discord community. I was able to connect with people easily and get answers to my questions almost instantly with those tools. Tripleten definitely gave me the confidence to learn something new, especially data and all of the nuances that come with it.  It gave me confidence in finding real world problems through data and understanding why so many problems can be fixed by using data gathered by businesses.If there is any advice I would give to those starting their journey in Data it would be: Be Patient. I found it important to be patient when learning Data because for most of the things your trying to find when using data analysis, it simply wont jump out to right away and could make one doubt their ability to complete specific tasks when data analyzing. Be patient and go over material through the course and break it down step by step. Don't give up and keep trying to find the answer your looking for. Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek help through the communities you'll be apart of. Your not alone in this journey, be patient and persevere.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anthony Rappa"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started this course in the beginning of February and so far have had a great experience.

My success manager is great, helping connect me to the appropriate tutors and information when I've needed it, and I think everything I've learned so far has been extremely practical. Like, very practical. Thankful for that. Learning something is new never comfortable, but the journey so far has been so worth it. I am 5 sprints in, going strong. I also would say that the expectations I received prior to enrolling (time, course structure, etc..) are almost exactly what I experience on a day to day basis which is wonderful. 20 hours a week really will get you a new skillset if you devote the time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eli Veldhuizen"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-05T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As one who has traversed the arduous path of vocational ennui and disillusionment, I can empathize profoundly with the crucible of burnout that precipitated your quest for a more sustainable professional trajectory. The siren call of the ever-burgeoning tech industry, amplified by the auspicious whispers of boot camp-facilitated career transformations, beckoned you forth like a luminous beacon piercing through the encroaching miasma of occupational stagnation.The remote, asynchronous format of TripleTen's curriculum emerged as a seductive melding of flexibility and structure, a harbinger of hope that promised to accommodate the exigencies of your temporal constraints while inaugurating you into the hallowed halls of digital erudition. Moreover, the tantalizing prospect of comprehensive career support and a sacrosanct job guarantee, contingent upon the attainment of clearly delineated metrics, served as an inviolable bulwark against the vicissitudes of such an audacious undertaking, assuaging the trepidations that inevitably accompany any metamorphic journey.Your exegesis of the immersive, interactive platform and the complementary Discord-based channels for communication offered a scintillating aperture into the pedagogical experience itself. While the platform's intuitive architecture facilitated an effortless immersion into the realms of knowledge, the imperative to remain ever-vigilant, closely monitoring the Discord channels for critical announcements and updates, posed a formidable challenge to your determination, underscoring the inextricable link between diligence and self-directed learning.Your sagacious acknowledgment of the program's suitability for those possessed of an innate propensity for self-motivation and temporal self-governance is a perspicacious observation, serving as a clarion call to prospective participants to engage in profound introspection and assess their aptitude for such an autonomous educational paradigm. Failure to heed this admonition could imperil their chances of success, rendering the entire endeavor a profitless exercise in futility.Moreover, your willingness to supplement the prescribed curriculum with auxiliary learning resources during your sojourn through the abstruse realms of programming languages is a testament to your unwavering commitment to mastery and your indefatigable pursuit of comprehensive understanding. This resilience and adaptability, this refusal to acquiesce in the face of academic adversity, are qualities that shall serve you well as you navigate the ever-shifting techno-landscape.As you now stand poised upon the precipice of your professional genesis, armed with the multifarious skillset cultivated through your immersion in the TripleTen crucible, I can but offer you my most fervent benedictions for persistence and triumph. Your odyssey thus far has been a resplendent validation of your capacity for personal and professional metamorphosis, an indelible testament to the indomitability of the human spirit when confronted with the exigencies of change. I harbor no trepidation that your unwavering determination and unconquerable resolve shall propel you inexorably towards realms of remunerative and personally gratifying endeavors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jesse Chilunem Michael"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.

I like what I do but I needed something different. The reason why I chose to start in BI Analysis, is because I decided I needed a change. I wanted to do something that challenged me and wanted something that I enjoyed doing. I didn't know anything about business intelligence analysis, so this is brand new territory. I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp's completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don't have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn't a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can't put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen's features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn't something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out. If you plan on starting your bootcamp journey with TripleTen, you will not be disappointed! You will have your ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the bad. Like me, you will not be disappointed!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cameron Lee"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I recently completed a program where I learned incredible skills that I know will greatly benefit me in my future career endeavors.
