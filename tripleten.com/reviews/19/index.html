I put my dream off for a while because I didn’t feel competent or confident to make the change. And then I found TripleTen. I had been considering another program but TripleTen’s full-stack just didn’t match up for the price tag. I also liked how the program was structured using Sprints. I can struggle to self-start and keep an independent pace, so the structure of Sprints holds me accountable to the deadline while preparing me for a real-life SWE job role. You are able to take breaks in the program as needed (they are even encouraged!). This was important to me because I work full-time and travel frequently. Once I had decided that TripleTen was the program that I wanted to move forward with I spoke with an advisor who further helped me to “hush” those thoughts telling me that I couldn’t do it – and I went for it! I am so happy that I did. The journey has been challenging but seeing your code come together is SO rewarding. The theory can be overwhelming at first. However, it is divided into text, visuals, videos, links to outside resources, and the interactive coding platform so it is easy to stay engaged. The platform is also visually appealing and easy to navigate. I highly recommend giving yourself enough time to complete the theory especially if you do not have any coding experience. And take notes! Keep a calendar and take breaks, you can do it! The best part of the program is the Discord server where you can interact with the Tutors, Success Managers, and other students. The Tutors do a great job of giving hints and explanations using videos, visuals, and detailed written feedback to guide you towards the solution rather than telling you the answer outright. They help you to critically think and encourage you to do your own research because that is going to help you be successful in the workforce. I have never had to wait more than two hours for a tutor to answer a question. There are also multiple office hours most days of the week, so there are frequent opportunities for support outside of Discord. If additional support is needed, you can ask for a 1:1 tutoring session. Senior students are also available to support you and will often chime in with feedback if you ask a question. The Success Managers check-in with you frequently, encourage you when warranted, and help you keep on pace. The whole community is really supportive and friendly. I haven’t fully immersed myself in the career prep coursework but the resources are abundant! If you are considering TripleTen as your coding bootcamp, I am here to tell you that the program is a 10/10 DO recommend!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Rachel Knight&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1706644800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66563#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The best career decision I&#39;ve made so far has been selecting TripleTen for a coding bootcamp. I was nervous to change my path from the healthcare industry to tech, after becoming burned out and tired of commuting for hours each day. I have no background or experience in coding, but I knew I wanted to create a lifestyle for my future where I could work from home while still doing something I love. The platform and coursework actually make learning coding fun and I have been able to apply what I&#39;ve learned to each project I complete. I have gained so many skills in data analysis that I never thought I could be doing. The best feeling is being proud of the work you complete after accomplishing a project. I chose TripleTen because of the amount of preparation and support they provide for getting a job in the real world, along with realistic challenges you may face. The program I selected is perfect for what I envisioned myself doing in the tech industry. All though it is self-paced, there are recommended milestones provided to keep you on track and many resources available for help and guidance. What separates TripleTen from other bootcamps, is that the tutors and success managers are encouraging and want you to succeed. Knowledge and help are given during the programs to ensure social media platforms, portfolios and interview skills are ready to begin job searching. If you are unsure about how to break into the tech world, TripleTen is the best place to start.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Owen Michael Patterson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1706731200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66578#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The reason I first started to look for a bootcamp was I wanted something REAL, like experience, that could tie my college degree together, since I only have an associates. TripleTen was a great addition to my educational journey. There were three things that I really wanted when it came to a bootcamp: needed to work with my schedule (I work 40+ hours a week and school), has REAL work experience and could help me secure a job afterwards. TripleTen offers all of this. They are a part time option which was not too demanding, and when I did need time off I was able to request it. This made it super easy to balance life, work, school and the bootcamp. Their externship program is legit, allowing their students to get ACTUAL real life experience. Along with their course material, which felt like I was actually learning something that would help me, it is pretty easy to score a programming position with them. They also offer, at least I think they still do, 100% money back guarantee, which has never been claimed by a student! Overall, I really enjoyed my time with TripleTen. I learned so much more about software engineering, which honestly is a huge passion of mine. I was even able to get a position with Hurley Medical Center as an Application Analyst! I would not say TripleTen was 100% the reason I was able to get this position, my college experience and experience at other positions at Hurley definitely helped, but I would 100% say that I do not regret taking the course. The knowledge and experienced I gained from it was amazing.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Shoba Santosh&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1706990400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66653#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This bootcamp has been challenging in the best way! The material is extremely thorough, from data cleaning to implementing machine learning models, and there are many wonderful, responsive tutors to help along the way. The projects are tough, and you learn a lot in the process of completing them. I love that the format of content allows me to study around my work schedule, and I am incredibly grateful for the extensions available for project submissions. I joined this bootcamp to move towards the machine learning field, and I strongly feel that it is helping me move in that direction. It can be difficult to balance study material with full time work, but it absolutely doable when you consistently show up (even for a small amount of time) every day. Now, I&#39;m pushing through my last few months in the bootcamp and getting started on the career prep work. I highly recommend this bootcamp for anyone wanting to enter or grow in the field of data science/machine learning and good luck to those of you who decide to join!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Saumya Nayak&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707163200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126693951?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66697#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I choose Triple Ten because it is giving 10 month duration to complete course work which is needed for me as am new in tech world.

I honestly feel ready to apply these skills to my next job opportunity, and just from have a foundational understanding of the concepts learned, I think it won&#39;t be long before I land that great job opportunity!

I love coding, and so I wanted to pursue options in software engineering.I did plentiful research on different coding bootcamps, but TripleTen stood out. I had seen reviews and watched YouTube summaries of the first couple sprints, and what caught my attention was the quick response to questions through the bootcamp&#39;s discord. I&#39;m a hard worker, and I can usually figure things out through my own research, but I knew there would be some abstract concepts that I just couldn&#39;t grasp - and the couple of times I needed questions answered, that process was very timely! TripleTen is organized into 15 sprints, preparing students for a career with deadlines. Initially we learn front-end development using HTML / CSS / JavaScript. This leads into using React, which is a framework combining JavaScript and HTML to dynamically design webpage elements. This part of the course was challenging but rewarding, because I began to feel like I could make anything I want happen on a web page with relative ease. After mastering many frontend design concepts, backend development began. I had a little bit of a background in databases, but not with the same technologies as TripleTen was teaching me. The coursework made the new information easy to grasp, and backend programming turned into my favorite! I loved finding out how the \&quot;guts\&quot; of a website run to make things like user authentication and dynamically updating website info happen. Finally, everything gets tied together in Sprint 14, and you really feel like you&#39;ve built a website that could expand to an infinite number of ideas. Sprint 15 walks you through cloud hosting, so friends and family can visit your website publicly by simply typing in a URL.The interactive platform gives check-in quizzes to see if you&#39;re keeping up with the vocabulary and concepts, and has many tasks that represent the skills you&#39;ll be using in that sprint&#39;s project while you&#39;re learning them. The projects expand on the tasks in a challenging way (but reasonably challenging!) There are things you&#39;ll have to research a bit on your own, but the mentors on the bootcamp&#39;s discord are right there if you&#39;ve done your research and couldn&#39;t quite find what you&#39;re looking for. I&#39;m hoping to get a start on an externship project for a real company soon! This is a project that the bootcamp offers if you&#39;re keeping up with the coursework - a company needs something built, and TripleTen makes sure it&#39;s appropriate for their students. TripleTen and the company will bolster your LinkedIn and resume with letters of recommendation afterwards!At the end of Sprint 15, I am incredibly satisfied with the progress I&#39;ve made. I feel I can have real conversations with other engineers, code using professional frameworks and methodologies, and learn new frameworks quickly when needed.If you do choose to go with TripleTen, here are some words of advice: structure your days around some time to work on the course. For me, I was able to set aside 7pm-9pm every weeknight, with a little more time on the weekends. TripleTen wants students to plan on 20 hours each week, and that&#39;s a pretty good estimate. Also, be willing to struggle! I had some pretty big mess-ups on projects that I didn&#39;t discover until later on; oversights that took a good amount of time to fix and correct the rest of the code that depended on my mistake. I learned a TON during that process, because mistakes are one of the most powerful learning tools! Finally, ask for help. Once you&#39;ve done your research and tried to find solutions to problems, the mentors are there to help. There are office hours and discord servers for individual sprints, so do not be afraid to start interacting with the community! Other students are there asking the same questions you probably are, and the mentor&#39;s answers to your questions might just help a future student!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Xander Ambrosio&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707508800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I always find myself wanting to create things. I&#39;m interested in game development, creating Excel sheets with formulas/functions for quick D&amp;D play, and building strategies that maximize my time. Becoming a Software Engineer was a no-brainer. Because of my schedule, however, I always thought I had to worry about school later in life. Then, scrolling through Instagram, of all places, I get an ad for an online bootcamp called TripleTen. After doing my research, I hopped on the bandwagon, reading that they are so confident in their job-hunting skills that they&#39;ll refund your tuition if you don&#39;t get a job is really exciting. There are no classes, a simple website with an interactive coding platform, and a discord server where you can ask questions and keep in contact with the community and your tutors. With a deadline every two weeks (sprints) for your projects, you&#39;ll be done before the end of the year. I love that at any time of those two weeks, I can work as long as I want whenever I want. Of course, as long as I turn in the project before the deadline. They recently made it where the career curriculum a part of the regular program, so that you can knock both out at the same time! I recommend that anyone getting into this program to start building small projects alongside the education, as that will really reinforce your skills and show that you really are learning something powerful from the education. I greatly recommend this program to anyone interested in Software Development, and I can&#39;t wait to get into this career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alex Tribbey&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707940800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102130393?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66940#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Around April and May last year, I was getting ready to graduate from college, and had little clue what I wanted to do with regard to a job. After doing some looking around, I began to take note of different tech boot camps that I heard about on the internet and from friends in the field. TripleTen was one of these, and after a bit of time spent deciding between my options, I decided that TripleTen, with it&#39;s tuition guarantee regarding employment, as well as their general flexibility with my work schedule, was the way to go. Since June of last year then, I have been going through the Software Engineering Program at TripleTen, and I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons. Firstly, the program. The program is divided into two week sections called, sprints which consist of theory sections (most of which have practice sections for you to immediately apply what you&#39;ve learned) and those sections of theory culminate in a project that draws together everything that you&#39;ve learned during the sprint (as well as information from each preceding sprint) and compresses it down into a well thought-out project that practically hits on every note that you studied in the theory for that sprint. I find this work loop very enjoyable and gratifying. When I first started the part of the program on JavaScript, for instance, I felt like a complete fool as I couldn&#39;t understand even the most basic elements of the language but as time has gone on, I have just finished the 13th of 15 sprints that focused on using my own database I created last week to add a new layer of security and authentication to make it secure using JavaScript, which, had you told me a few months ago I would do, I would&#39;ve thought you were lying.Secondly, the faculty. Like previously mentioned, when I first started JavaScript, as well as many other moments throughout my course, I have had times where I really began to think that I just couldn&#39;t do it. I thought I wasn&#39;t smart enough for it, and I was just gonna end up falling flat, but thanks to encouragement from the staff at TripleTen, whether it be from my community manager, or the tutors who helped me through rough patches, I stuck to it and kept on going until things finally started to sink in and make sense. I have always felt very comfortable asking pretty much any questions that come to mind when I am having difficulty, because every tutor I have worked with has been patient and quick to help me understand things, no matter how many questions I had to ask until it finally clicked. This has been greatly appreciated, and I am not sure whether or not I would have stuck with the program had I not had encouragement from the staff and my family during discouraging sections of the lessons.Thirdly and finally, the focus of the staff on practical application especially when it comes to career-prep and understanding of what it takes to get and maintain a job in this field. At the end of almost every sprint is an entire chapter, (and sometimes more than one) dedicated to specific aspects of the job search. The first few have you setting up a solid GitHub that is appealing to employers, followed be a LinkedIn, then how to write a proper Resume for the field, and so on. Their desire to make sure you are employed after your time with TripleTen is clear, and very encouraging. I am going to be married in two months, so having the confidence that I have gained concerning my ability to get a job in this field that I have gained from my TripleTen is in my mind priceless.There are a number of other reasons I could cite, but for the sake of brevity, I will leave it at those three. I am thoroughly pleased with my time at TripleTen, and though my time with them is drawing to a close soon, I will always be thankful to them for helping me get started in my dream career as quickly and efficiently as they have. I could not recommend the program enough, especially if you were like me, namely, completely green, but very interested in the software engineering field and not knowing where to start. I believe TripleTen is the best place to do so.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;BERNARD&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707940800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66937#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;So, I recently wrapped up my time at Triple Ten Bootcamp, and I gotta say, it was alright. Overall, my experience fell into the solid category. The information they dished out was pretty solid, no doubt about that. But hey, if you ask me, I think diving deeper into the content wouldn&#39;t hurt. You know, soak up as much knowledge as humanly possible. After all, learning is a lifelong journey, right?I wrapped things up around the end of October and now I&#39;m knee-deep in the job hunt. It&#39;s a process, but hey, gotta start somewhere, right? So, while I&#39;m still figuring out my next moves, I&#39;ll definitely drop another review once I&#39;ve get the job experience under my belt. I mean, that&#39;s probably why you&#39;re reading this review, right? To get the full scoop.Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents for now.

I had been considering another program but TripleTen’s full-stack just didn’t match up for the price tag. I also liked how the program was structured using Sprints. I can struggle to self-start and keep an independent pace, so the structure of Sprints holds me accountable to the deadline while preparing me for a real-life SWE job role. You are able to take breaks in the program as needed (they are even encouraged!). This was important to me because I work full-time and travel frequently. Once I had decided that TripleTen was the program that I wanted to move forward with I spoke with an advisor who further helped me to “hush” those thoughts telling me that I couldn’t do it – and I went for it! I am so happy that I did. The journey has been challenging but seeing your code come together is SO rewarding. The theory can be overwhelming at first. However, it is divided into text, visuals, videos, links to outside resources, and the interactive coding platform so it is easy to stay engaged. The platform is also visually appealing and easy to navigate. I highly recommend giving yourself enough time to complete the theory especially if you do not have any coding experience. And take notes! Keep a calendar and take breaks, you can do it! The best part of the program is the Discord server where you can interact with the Tutors, Success Managers, and other students. The Tutors do a great job of giving hints and explanations using videos, visuals, and detailed written feedback to guide you towards the solution rather than telling you the answer outright. They help you to critically think and encourage you to do your own research because that is going to help you be successful in the workforce. I have never had to wait more than two hours for a tutor to answer a question. There are also multiple office hours most days of the week, so there are frequent opportunities for support outside of Discord. If additional support is needed, you can ask for a 1:1 tutoring session. Senior students are also available to support you and will often chime in with feedback if you ask a question. The Success Managers check-in with you frequently, encourage you when warranted, and help you keep on pace. The whole community is really supportive and friendly. I haven’t fully immersed myself in the career prep coursework but the resources are abundant! If you are considering TripleTen as your coding bootcamp, I am here to tell you that the program is a 10/10 DO recommend! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66543#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Rachel Knight</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>The best career decision I&#39;ve made so far has been selecting TripleTen for a coding bootcamp.

The platform and coursework actually make learning coding fun and I have been able to apply what I&#39;ve learned to each project I complete. I have gained so many skills in data analysis that I never thought I could be doing. The best feeling is being proud of the work you complete after accomplishing a project. I chose TripleTen because of the amount of preparation and support they provide for getting a job in the real world, along with realistic challenges you may face. The program I selected is perfect for what I envisioned myself doing in the tech industry. All though it is self-paced, there are recommended milestones provided to keep you on track and many resources available for help and guidance. What separates TripleTen from other bootcamps, is that the tutors and success managers are encouraging and want you to succeed. Knowledge and help are given during the programs to ensure social media platforms, portfolios and interview skills are ready to begin job searching. If you are unsure about how to break into the tech world, TripleTen is the best place to start. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66563#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Owen Michael Patterson</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>The reason I first started to look for a bootcamp was I wanted something REAL, like experience, that could tie my college degree together, since I only have an associates.

TripleTen offers all of this. They are a part time option which was not too demanding, and when I did need time off I was able to request it. This made it super easy to balance life, work, school and the bootcamp. Their externship program is legit, allowing their students to get ACTUAL real life experience. Along with their course material, which felt like I was actually learning something that would help me, it is pretty easy to score a programming position with them. They also offer, at least I think they still do, 100% money back guarantee, which has never been claimed by a student! Overall, I really enjoyed my time with TripleTen. I learned so much more about software engineering, which honestly is a huge passion of mine. I was even able to get a position with Hurley Medical Center as an Application Analyst! I would not say TripleTen was 100% the reason I was able to get this position, my college experience and experience at other positions at Hurley definitely helped, but I would 100% say that I do not regret taking the course. The knowledge and experienced I gained from it was amazing. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66578#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Shoba Santosh</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>This bootcamp has been challenging in the best way!

I love coding, and so I wanted to pursue options in software engineering.I did plentiful ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>research on different coding bootcamps, but TripleTen stood out. I had seen reviews and watched YouTube summaries of the first couple sprints, and what caught my attention was the quick response to questions through the bootcamp&#39;s discord. I&#39;m a hard worker, and I can usually figure things out through my own research, but I knew there would be some abstract concepts that I just couldn&#39;t grasp - and the couple of times I needed questions answered, that process was very timely! TripleTen is organized into 15 sprints, preparing students for a career with deadlines. Initially we learn front-end development using HTML / CSS / JavaScript. This leads into using React, which is a framework combining JavaScript and HTML to dynamically design webpage elements. This part of the course was challenging but rewarding, because I began to feel like I could make anything I want happen on a web page with relative ease. After mastering many frontend design concepts, backend development began. I had a little bit of a background in databases, but not with the same technologies as TripleTen was teaching me. The coursework made the new information easy to grasp, and backend programming turned into my favorite! I loved finding out how the &quot;guts&quot; of a website run to make things like user authentication and dynamically updating website info happen. Finally, everything gets tied together in Sprint 14, and you really feel like you&#39;ve built a website that could expand to an infinite number of ideas. Sprint 15 walks you through cloud hosting, so friends and family can visit your website publicly by simply typing in a URL.The interactive platform gives check-in quizzes to see if you&#39;re keeping up with the vocabulary and concepts, and has many tasks that represent the skills you&#39;ll be using in that sprint&#39;s project while you&#39;re learning them. The projects expand on the tasks in a challenging way (but reasonably challenging!) There are things you&#39;ll have to research a bit on your own, but the mentors on the bootcamp&#39;s discord are right there if you&#39;ve done your research and couldn&#39;t quite find what you&#39;re looking for. I&#39;m hoping to get a start on an externship project for a real company soon! This is a project that the bootcamp offers if you&#39;re keeping up with the coursework - a company needs something built, and TripleTen makes sure it&#39;s appropriate for their students. TripleTen and the company will bolster your LinkedIn and resume with letters of recommendation afterwards!At the end of Sprint 15, I am incredibly satisfied with the progress I&#39;ve made. I feel I can have real conversations with other engineers, code using professional frameworks and methodologies, and learn new frameworks quickly when needed.If you do choose to go with TripleTen, here are some words of advice: structure your days around some time to work on the course. For me, I was able to set aside 7pm-9pm every weeknight, with a little more time on the weekends. TripleTen wants students to plan on 20 hours each week, and that&#39;s a pretty good estimate. Also, be willing to struggle! I had some pretty big mess-ups on projects that I didn&#39;t discover until later on; oversights that took a good amount of time to fix and correct the rest of the code that depended on my mistake. I learned a TON during that process, because mistakes are one of the most powerful learning tools! Finally, ask for help. Once you&#39;ve done your research and tried to find solutions to problems, the mentors are there to help. There are office hours and discord servers for individual sprints, so do not be afraid to start interacting with the community! Other students are there asking the same questions you probably are, and the mentor&#39;s answers to your questions might just help a future student! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66817#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Xander Ambrosio</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I always find myself wanting to create things.

Then, scrolling through Instagram, of all places, I get an ad for an online bootcamp called TripleTen. After doing my research, I hopped on the bandwagon, reading that they are so confident in their job-hunting skills that they&#39;ll refund your tuition if you don&#39;t get a job is really exciting. There are no classes, a simple website with an interactive coding platform, and a discord server where you can ask questions and keep in contact with the community and your tutors. With a deadline every two weeks (sprints) for your projects, you&#39;ll be done before the end of the year. I love that at any time of those two weeks, I can work as long as I want whenever I want. Of course, as long as I turn in the project before the deadline. They recently made it where the career curriculum a part of the regular program, so that you can knock both out at the same time! I recommend that anyone getting into this program to start building small projects alongside the education, as that will really reinforce your skills and show that you really are learning something powerful from the education. I greatly recommend this program to anyone interested in Software Development, and I can&#39;t wait to get into this career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102130393?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alex Tribbey</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Around April and May last year, I was getting ready to graduate from college, and had little clue what I wanted to do with regard to a job. After doing some looking around, I began to take note of different tech boot camps that I heard about on the internet and from friends in the field. TripleTen w... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>as one of these, and after a bit of time spent deciding between my options, I decided that TripleTen, with it&#39;s tuition guarantee regarding employment, as well as their general flexibility with my work schedule, was the way to go. Since June of last year then, I have been going through the Software Engineering Program at TripleTen, and I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons. Firstly, the program. The program is divided into two week sections called, sprints which consist of theory sections (most of which have practice sections for you to immediately apply what you&#39;ve learned) and those sections of theory culminate in a project that draws together everything that you&#39;ve learned during the sprint (as well as information from each preceding sprint) and compresses it down into a well thought-out project that practically hits on every note that you studied in the theory for that sprint. I find this work loop very enjoyable and gratifying. When I first started the part of the program on JavaScript, for instance, I felt like a complete fool as I couldn&#39;t understand even the most basic elements of the language but as time has gone on, I have just finished the 13th of 15 sprints that focused on using my own database I created last week to add a new layer of security and authentication to make it secure using JavaScript, which, had you told me a few months ago I would do, I would&#39;ve thought you were lying.Secondly, the faculty. Like previously mentioned, when I first started JavaScript, as well as many other moments throughout my course, I have had times where I really began to think that I just couldn&#39;t do it. I thought I wasn&#39;t smart enough for it, and I was just gonna end up falling flat, but thanks to encouragement from the staff at TripleTen, whether it be from my community manager, or the tutors who helped me through rough patches, I stuck to it and kept on going until things finally started to sink in and make sense. I have always felt very comfortable asking pretty much any questions that come to mind when I am having difficulty, because every tutor I have worked with has been patient and quick to help me understand things, no matter how many questions I had to ask until it finally clicked. This has been greatly appreciated, and I am not sure whether or not I would have stuck with the program had I not had encouragement from the staff and my family during discouraging sections of the lessons.Thirdly and finally, the focus of the staff on practical application especially when it comes to career-prep and understanding of what it takes to get and maintain a job in this field. At the end of almost every sprint is an entire chapter, (and sometimes more than one) dedicated to specific aspects of the job search. The first few have you setting up a solid GitHub that is appealing to employers, followed be a LinkedIn, then how to write a proper Resume for the field, and so on. Their desire to make sure you are employed after your time with TripleTen is clear, and very encouraging. I am going to be married in two months, so having the confidence that I have gained concerning my ability to get a job in this field that I have gained from my TripleTen is in my mind priceless.There are a number of other reasons I could cite, but for the sake of brevity, I will leave it at those three. I am thoroughly pleased with my time at TripleTen, and though my time with them is drawing to a close soon, I will always be thankful to them for helping me get started in my dream career as quickly and efficiently as they have. I could not recommend the program enough, especially if you were like me, namely, completely green, but very interested in the software engineering field and not knowing where to start. I believe TripleTen is the best place to do so. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66940#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>BERNARD</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>So, I recently wrapped up my time at Triple Ten Bootcamp, and I gotta say, it was alright.

I put my dream off for a while because I didn’t feel competent or confident to make the change. And then I found TripleTen. I had been considering another program but TripleTen’s full-stack just didn’t match up for the price tag. I also liked how the program was structured using Sprints. I can struggle to self-start and keep an independent pace, so the structure of Sprints holds me accountable to the deadline while preparing me for a real-life SWE job role. You are able to take breaks in the program as needed (they are even encouraged!). This was important to me because I work full-time and travel frequently. Once I had decided that TripleTen was the program that I wanted to move forward with I spoke with an advisor who further helped me to “hush” those thoughts telling me that I couldn’t do it – and I went for it! I am so happy that I did. The journey has been challenging but seeing your code come together is SO rewarding. The theory can be overwhelming at first. However, it is divided into text, visuals, videos, links to outside resources, and the interactive coding platform so it is easy to stay engaged. The platform is also visually appealing and easy to navigate. I highly recommend giving yourself enough time to complete the theory especially if you do not have any coding experience. And take notes! Keep a calendar and take breaks, you can do it! The best part of the program is the Discord server where you can interact with the Tutors, Success Managers, and other students. The Tutors do a great job of giving hints and explanations using videos, visuals, and detailed written feedback to guide you towards the solution rather than telling you the answer outright. They help you to critically think and encourage you to do your own research because that is going to help you be successful in the workforce. I have never had to wait more than two hours for a tutor to answer a question. There are also multiple office hours most days of the week, so there are frequent opportunities for support outside of Discord. If additional support is needed, you can ask for a 1:1 tutoring session. Senior students are also available to support you and will often chime in with feedback if you ask a question. The Success Managers check-in with you frequently, encourage you when warranted, and help you keep on pace. The whole community is really supportive and friendly. I haven’t fully immersed myself in the career prep coursework but the resources are abundant! If you are considering TripleTen as your coding bootcamp, I am here to tell you that the program is a 10/10 DO recommend!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ellery Hammond"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"The best career decision I've made so far has been selecting TripleTen for a coding bootcamp. I was nervous to change my path from the healthcare industry to tech, after becoming burned out and tired of commuting for hours each day. I have no background or experience in coding, but I knew I wanted to create a lifestyle for my future where I could work from home while still doing something I love. The platform and coursework actually make learning coding fun and I have been able to apply what I've learned to each project I complete. I have gained so many skills in data analysis that I never thought I could be doing. The best feeling is being proud of the work you complete after accomplishing a project. I chose TripleTen because of the amount of preparation and support they provide for getting a job in the real world, along with realistic challenges you may face. The program I selected is perfect for what I envisioned myself doing in the tech industry. All though it is self-paced, there are recommended milestones provided to keep you on track and many resources available for help and guidance. What separates TripleTen from other bootcamps, is that the tutors and success managers are encouraging and want you to succeed. Knowledge and help are given during the programs to ensure social media platforms, portfolios and interview skills are ready to begin job searching. If you are unsure about how to break into the tech world, TripleTen is the best place to start.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rachel Knight"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-31T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"The reason I first started to look for a bootcamp was I wanted something REAL, like experience, that could tie my college degree together, since I only have an associates. TripleTen was a great addition to my educational journey. There were three things that I really wanted when it came to a bootcamp: needed to work with my schedule (I work 40+ hours a week and school), has REAL work experience and could help me secure a job afterwards. TripleTen offers all of this. They are a part time option which was not too demanding, and when I did need time off I was able to request it. This made it super easy to balance life, work, school and the bootcamp. Their externship program is legit, allowing their students to get ACTUAL real life experience. Along with their course material, which felt like I was actually learning something that would help me, it is pretty easy to score a programming position with them. They also offer, at least I think they still do, 100% money back guarantee, which has never been claimed by a student! Overall, I really enjoyed my time with TripleTen. I learned so much more about software engineering, which honestly is a huge passion of mine. I was even able to get a position with Hurley Medical Center as an Application Analyst! I would not say TripleTen was 100% the reason I was able to get this position, my college experience and experience at other positions at Hurley definitely helped, but I would 100% say that I do not regret taking the course. The knowledge and experienced I gained from it was amazing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Owen Michael Patterson"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-03T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This bootcamp has been challenging in the best way!

It can be difficult to balance study material with full time work, but it absolutely doable when you consistently show up (even for a small amount of time) every day.

I love coding, and so I wanted to pursue options in software engineering.I did plentiful research on different coding bootcamps, but TripleTen stood out. I had seen reviews and watched YouTube summaries of the first couple sprints, and what caught my attention was the quick response to questions through the bootcamp's discord. I'm a hard worker, and I can usually figure things out through my own research, but I knew there would be some abstract concepts that I just couldn't grasp - and the couple of times I needed questions answered, that process was very timely! TripleTen is organized into 15 sprints, preparing students for a career with deadlines. Initially we learn front-end development using HTML / CSS / JavaScript. This leads into using React, which is a framework combining JavaScript and HTML to dynamically design webpage elements. This part of the course was challenging but rewarding, because I began to feel like I could make anything I want happen on a web page with relative ease. After mastering many frontend design concepts, backend development began. I had a little bit of a background in databases, but not with the same technologies as TripleTen was teaching me. The coursework made the new information easy to grasp, and backend programming turned into my favorite! I loved finding out how the \"guts\" of a website run to make things like user authentication and dynamically updating website info happen. Finally, everything gets tied together in Sprint 14, and you really feel like you've built a website that could expand to an infinite number of ideas. Sprint 15 walks you through cloud hosting, so friends and family can visit your website publicly by simply typing in a URL.The interactive platform gives check-in quizzes to see if you're keeping up with the vocabulary and concepts, and has many tasks that represent the skills you'll be using in that sprint's project while you're learning them. The projects expand on the tasks in a challenging way (but reasonably challenging!) There are things you'll have to research a bit on your own, but the mentors on the bootcamp's discord are right there if you've done your research and couldn't quite find what you're looking for. I'm hoping to get a start on an externship project for a real company soon! This is a project that the bootcamp offers if you're keeping up with the coursework - a company needs something built, and TripleTen makes sure it's appropriate for their students. TripleTen and the company will bolster your LinkedIn and resume with letters of recommendation afterwards!At the end of Sprint 15, I am incredibly satisfied with the progress I've made. I feel I can have real conversations with other engineers, code using professional frameworks and methodologies, and learn new frameworks quickly when needed.If you do choose to go with TripleTen, here are some words of advice: structure your days around some time to work on the course. For me, I was able to set aside 7pm-9pm every weeknight, with a little more time on the weekends. TripleTen wants students to plan on 20 hours each week, and that's a pretty good estimate. Also, be willing to struggle! I had some pretty big mess-ups on projects that I didn't discover until later on; oversights that took a good amount of time to fix and correct the rest of the code that depended on my mistake. I learned a TON during that process, because mistakes are one of the most powerful learning tools! Finally, ask for help. Once you've done your research and tried to find solutions to problems, the mentors are there to help. There are office hours and discord servers for individual sprints, so do not be afraid to start interacting with the community! Other students are there asking the same questions you probably are, and the mentor's answers to your questions might just help a future student!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Marzahl"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I always find myself wanting to create things. I'm interested in game development, creating Excel sheets with formulas/functions for quick D&D play, and building strategies that maximize my time. Becoming a Software Engineer was a no-brainer. Because of my schedule, however, I always thought I had to worry about school later in life. Then, scrolling through Instagram, of all places, I get an ad for an online bootcamp called TripleTen. After doing my research, I hopped on the bandwagon, reading that they are so confident in their job-hunting skills that they'll refund your tuition if you don't get a job is really exciting. There are no classes, a simple website with an interactive coding platform, and a discord server where you can ask questions and keep in contact with the community and your tutors. With a deadline every two weeks (sprints) for your projects, you'll be done before the end of the year. I love that at any time of those two weeks, I can work as long as I want whenever I want. Of course, as long as I turn in the project before the deadline. They recently made it where the career curriculum a part of the regular program, so that you can knock both out at the same time! I recommend that anyone getting into this program to start building small projects alongside the education, as that will really reinforce your skills and show that you really are learning something powerful from the education. I greatly recommend this program to anyone interested in Software Development, and I can't wait to get into this career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Xander Ambrosio"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Around April and May last year, I was getting ready to graduate from college, and had little clue what I wanted to do with regard to a job. After doing some looking around, I began to take note of different tech boot camps that I heard about on the internet and from friends in the field. TripleTen was one of these, and after a bit of time spent deciding between my options, I decided that TripleTen, with it's tuition guarantee regarding employment, as well as their general flexibility with my work schedule, was the way to go. Since June of last year then, I have been going through the Software Engineering Program at TripleTen, and I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons. Firstly, the program. The program is divided into two week sections called, sprints which consist of theory sections (most of which have practice sections for you to immediately apply what you've learned) and those sections of theory culminate in a project that draws together everything that you've learned during the sprint (as well as information from each preceding sprint) and compresses it down into a well thought-out project that practically hits on every note that you studied in the theory for that sprint. I find this work loop very enjoyable and gratifying. When I first started the part of the program on JavaScript, for instance, I felt like a complete fool as I couldn't understand even the most basic elements of the language but as time has gone on, I have just finished the 13th of 15 sprints that focused on using my own database I created last week to add a new layer of security and authentication to make it secure using JavaScript, which, had you told me a few months ago I would do, I would've thought you were lying.Secondly, the faculty. Like previously mentioned, when I first started JavaScript, as well as many other moments throughout my course, I have had times where I really began to think that I just couldn't do it. I thought I wasn't smart enough for it, and I was just gonna end up falling flat, but thanks to encouragement from the staff at TripleTen, whether it be from my community manager, or the tutors who helped me through rough patches, I stuck to it and kept on going until things finally started to sink in and make sense. I have always felt very comfortable asking pretty much any questions that come to mind when I am having difficulty, because every tutor I have worked with has been patient and quick to help me understand things, no matter how many questions I had to ask until it finally clicked. This has been greatly appreciated, and I am not sure whether or not I would have stuck with the program had I not had encouragement from the staff and my family during discouraging sections of the lessons.Thirdly and finally, the focus of the staff on practical application especially when it comes to career-prep and understanding of what it takes to get and maintain a job in this field. At the end of almost every sprint is an entire chapter, (and sometimes more than one) dedicated to specific aspects of the job search. The first few have you setting up a solid GitHub that is appealing to employers, followed be a LinkedIn, then how to write a proper Resume for the field, and so on. Their desire to make sure you are employed after your time with TripleTen is clear, and very encouraging. I am going to be married in two months, so having the confidence that I have gained concerning my ability to get a job in this field that I have gained from my TripleTen is in my mind priceless.There are a number of other reasons I could cite, but for the sake of brevity, I will leave it at those three. I am thoroughly pleased with my time at TripleTen, and though my time with them is drawing to a close soon, I will always be thankful to them for helping me get started in my dream career as quickly and efficiently as they have. I could not recommend the program enough, especially if you were like me, namely, completely green, but very interested in the software engineering field and not knowing where to start. I believe TripleTen is the best place to do so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alex Tribbey"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"So, I recently wrapped up my time at Triple Ten Bootcamp, and I gotta say, it was alright. Overall, my experience fell into the solid category. The information they dished out was pretty solid, no doubt about that. But hey, if you ask me, I think diving deeper into the content wouldn't hurt. You know, soak up as much knowledge as humanly possible. After all, learning is a lifelong journey, right?I wrapped things up around the end of October and now I'm knee-deep in the job hunt. It's a process, but hey, gotta start somewhere, right? So, while I'm still figuring out my next moves, I'll definitely drop another review once I've get the job experience under my belt. I mean, that's probably why you're reading this review, right? To get the full scoop.Anyway, that's my two cents for now.
