After researching a little more about the company and what tech role I wanted to pursue. I reached out to meet with an advisor to dismiss any doubts I had about starting a new career. At the conclusion of my meeting I was convinced to start a 2 week trial that helped me understand the pace and information I would begin to learn during the boot camp. What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program. I would recommend this boot camp to anyone who wants to start their career in tech due to the amount of support that is constantly provided.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Nicholas Ventura&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719000000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/66775997d305a18110395c30/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This is excellent coursework that I am enjoying very much.

I would highly recommend TripleTen to anyone looking to enter or advance in this field. This bootcamp truly deserves a perfect rating of 5 out of 5.If you&#39;re serious about becoming a software engineer and want a program that goes above and beyond, look no further than TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Billy Samboy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719518400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/593f13e60000ff000aa2f1cb/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This bootcamp is setup perfectly for those that have zero experience in the tech field and actually come from a completely different work experience background like construction or manual labor.

One thing I&#39;ve learned in this course is that even though I don&#39;t have a college degree, I&#39;ll still be able to find a good job with a good salary. My best friend started the TripleTen software engineering course, and he only had good things to say, so I decided to give it a shot as well. They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There&#39;s also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It&#39;s broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there&#39;s actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn&#39;t going away any time soon.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Justice Joshua Caleb Cupples&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719950400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160805779?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70427#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age. A friend of mine got me back into programming and I decided to try bootcamps because they are objectively better than colleges if you plan to pursue a career in software. When I found TripleTen I honestly didn&#39;t believe their claims of jobs, coaching, and real-world experience. But it looked promising enough. So, I did a TON of research and found out it was actually true and wasn&#39;t just lies like so many bootcamps out there. I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I&#39;ve tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier. All in all, I highly recommend TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ian Stuart&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1720036800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70471#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I took on the TripleTen bootcamp to learn what it meant to be a Software Engineer and explore a shift in my career path. Months in and I&#39;m happy I decided to sign up. The tutors and guides really want you to succeed and make themselves available on a daily basis to answer questions, provide feedback, or really to help you in any way they can. The lesson plans are clearly defined and offer in depth practice for each language you&#39;ll be exposed to. The deadlines for finishing a Sprint (2 week lesson plan) are always clearly shown and your Success Manager will check in to be sure you&#39;re still on track to finishing and offer support if you need more time or have questions. All in all, I&#39;m really impressed by the coursework and am appreciative of the tutors for their help so far.

What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program. I would recommend this boot camp to anyone who wants to start their career in tech due to the amount of support that is constantly provided. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70166#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/66775997d305a18110395c30/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Nicholas Ventura</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>This is excellent coursework that I am enjoying very much.

They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There&#39;s also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It&#39;s broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there&#39;s actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn&#39;t going away any time soon. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70411#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160805779?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Justice Joshua Caleb Cupples</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ve always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age.

I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I&#39;ve tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier.

What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program. I would recommend this boot camp to anyone who wants to start their career in tech due to the amount of support that is constantly provided.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Blake Bailey"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-21T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This is excellent coursework that I am enjoying very much.

One thing I've learned in this course is that even though I don't have a college degree, I'll still be able to find a good job with a good salary. My best friend started the TripleTen software engineering course, and he only had good things to say, so I decided to give it a shot as well. They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There's also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It's broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there's actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn't have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn't going away any time soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bree Massingill"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-02T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age. A friend of mine got me back into programming and I decided to try bootcamps because they are objectively better than colleges if you plan to pursue a career in software. When I found TripleTen I honestly didn't believe their claims of jobs, coaching, and real-world experience. But it looked promising enough. So, I did a TON of research and found out it was actually true and wasn't just lies like so many bootcamps out there. I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I've tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier. All in all, I highly recommend TripleTen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Justice Joshua Caleb Cupples"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-03T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I took on the TripleTen bootcamp to learn what it meant to be a Software Engineer and explore a shift in my career path. Months in and I'm happy I decided to sign up. The tutors and guides really want you to succeed and make themselves available on a daily basis to answer questions, provide feedback, or really to help you in any way they can. The lesson plans are clearly defined and offer in depth practice for each language you'll be exposed to. The deadlines for finishing a Sprint (2 week lesson plan) are always clearly shown and your Success Manager will check in to be sure you're still on track to finishing and offer support if you need more time or have questions. All in all, I'm really impressed by the coursework and am appreciative of the tutors for their help so far.
