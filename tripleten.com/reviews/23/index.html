My decision to delve into data science was driven by a passion for uncovering actionable insights from data and leveraging them to drive informed decision-making across various domains.When researching platforms to kickstart my coding journey, I was drawn to TripleTen for its comprehensive approach to learning data science, data analysis, and business intelligence (BI) analysis. What appealed to me most about TripleTen was its interactive platform, which offered hands-on learning experiences through engaging projects and real-world case studies.In terms of my study routine with TripleTen, I organized my learning sessions by setting aside dedicated time each day to engage with the platform&#39;s resources. I typically spent several hours per week immersed in coding exercises, exploring datasets, and collaborating with peers on group projects. Furthermore, I actively participated in workshops and webinars offered by TripleTen to deepen my understanding of key concepts and stay updated on industry trends.TripleTen has played a pivotal role in my coding journey by equipping me with the technical skills, practical knowledge, and confidence needed to pursue my goals of becoming a data specialist. The platform&#39;s user-friendly interface, comprehensive curriculum, and hands-on learning approach have accelerated my learning trajectory and empowered me to tackle real-world data challenges with ease.For those embarking on their coding journey, I offer the following tips and advice:Set aside dedicated time each day or week to engage with coding exercises and projects. Leverage the power of community and teamwork to learn from others and gain different perspectives. Reinforce your learning by actively practicing coding skills and applying them to real-world scenarios.Explore new concepts, tools, and technologies to continuously expand your knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of data science.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy Maldonado&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67768#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I researched a variety of bootcamps looking for one that would give me the better bang for my buck. Let&#39;s be real, it&#39;s hard out there. It is definitely worth it. At first, it was rough, especially since I had no background on coding. My success manager made sure to reassure me that there are tools out there for help and pointed me in the right direction. There are tutors to help, fellow students, AI help, all you need is to bring your best intentions to succeed. I use the knowledge base section on the platform a lot to practice my skills. The recommended time per week to invest on your education is at least 10 hours. You can put in more work, if you have the time. I put in about 10-12 and still manage to maintain myself ahead. My only negative comment is that I am a visual learner, and a few of the chapters were harder on me, because I could not visualize the information provided. I do rely more on the workshops and AI to visualize the topics covered, as well as practice AD nauseum. I have learned vital information to my future career as a Business Intelligence Analyst, I have no doubt I made the right choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Claudia Gracia Licor&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132604059?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67771#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I became interested in coding and software engineering about a year ago, shortly after I found TripleTen. I booked a call and got to learn a lot about it, and I knew I had made the right choice. I started in TripleTen in mid October of last year and in the short time I&#39;ve been a student I learned so much. I didn&#39;t just learn how to code but I learned time management, life balance, how to prioritize what&#39;s most important, and most importantly how to take care of myself and what matters to me. During my time at TripleTen I&#39;ve unfortunately been sick a couple times in which the TripleTen team was extremely understanding and organized extensions and encouraged me to take time off if I ever needed it. The community is amazing, caring, and understanding. Success Managers, Tutors and other students are always ready to lend a hand whenever you need it. TripleTen is the right choice if you&#39;re looking for a place to embrace learning and learn from the very best. You get advice from real software engineers who will give you tips to pass your code reviews, while teaching you the best practices and making sure that you understand where the information comes from.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Mia Wertz&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67752#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Back in December 2023, I decided to leave a job where I was underpaid and over-stressed. I wanted to switch gears, and I wanted to work less on the front end (dealing with customers day in, day out) and work more behind the scenes. As I was looking around online for options, I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into the Business Intelligence Analytics program. Now, I am so thankful that I made the spur-of-the-moment decision to just... start. The courses are challenging enough to be fulfilling but not hard enough to make me want to pull my hair out. When it gets more difficult, there are numerous ways to find support, whether directly from a tutor or going through archived conversations within the community. The content is straightforward, the price is fair, the support staff is kind and knowledgeable, and the career advancement courses help make the job search feel structured and less intimidating. I&#39;m very thankful I found this boot camp. I&#39;m feeling a lot more competent, I have an increased sense of self-efficacy, I&#39;m enjoying learning (I almost always do but this boot camp is easy to enjoy, and I&#39;m making new connections through the community. I&#39;m really looking forward to finding a job in my field and continuing on to the next section of this new chapter in my life!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brian McElroy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710878400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My experience, as someone who had already acquired a number of Data Science skills in undergrad from working on publications involving big data, is that TripleTen is still worth it if you are looking to break into one of the four industries they currently support. Yes, I knew coding, statistics, data collection, SQL and machine learning going into the program, but I soon discovered there are industry-specific libraries, frameworks, and practices that startups and tech companies want you to be versed in that I knew nothing about. I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kristi I.&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710878400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22206542?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67807#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I wanted to pursue QA engineering due to a passion for software cultivated from my previous job as a quality operations consultant for software in automated vehicles. With such, I gained interest in ensuring that software can deliver expectations and beyond to its users. However, my previous job experience, while dipping into the domain of quality assurance, used specialized techniques and processes. I wanted to gain proper guidance and mentorship in learning quality assurance, especially learning industry standards and best practices. I chose TripleTen due to outstanding reviews from various sites. I also perused the offers of career support, access to a community of aspiring learners, and externships. These offerings made TripleTen stand out for me, and ultimately, I chose TripleTen as my boot camp. Nearing the end of my learning journey, it is sufficient to say I do not regret choosing TripleTen one bit. I love the interactive learning platform with the various articles and activities to learn from. The projects were stellar, and I learned so much from the application. It was easy to get help from the staff, whether it be technical support or help in theory or projects. It was also fun to connect and learn with the other students in the Discord community. TripleTen offered an amazing educational experience, and I feel better equipped for the job search and career journey as a QA engineer.I would like to thank TripleTen and its staff for being amazing at what they do, and I am excited to continue my learning journey with them.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dino Black&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710964800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67854#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started this program because I have a great passion for technology and storytelling. Being in data-driven environments has become quite a normalcy in my day-to-day work in the automotive industry. So I wanted a change; I wanted to work towards becoming an influencer, an advisor, and a storyteller to help leadership make data-driven decisions that mattered. So here I am, in this amazing bootcamp. Currently, I&#39;m halfway through my business intelligence analytics program, and honestly, it&#39;s a great feeling. The program has been very interactive, filled with great theory and hands-on exercises that ultimately lead to projects. I highly recommend this program if you&#39;re looking for a chance to gain a new skillset and if you&#39;re looking for an opportunity to transition careers into the technology industry. My advice is to show up for yourself and take it one day at a time. Be patient with yourself, ask for help, and don&#39;t get discouraged&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michaela Budde&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710964800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67843#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I don&#39;t think I could have found a more effective and affordable program than TripleTen. I left the education field for software engineering and needed a program that would be fairly fast, thorough and affordable. I found all of those things in their SE program. Not including the time I took off, it took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it&#39;s been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheena Irvin&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711137600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67916#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I had a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen&#39;s features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined. Be sure that this is something you’d be passionate about- bc it won’t be easy. You will always be learning and will be challenged. This idea excites me, so if it doesn’t excite you- really think about what you want to do. They do offer other bootcamps as well for data analytics, data science, and QA&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;ANDRES LAUSON&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711310400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67978#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My name is Andres, originally from Venezuela and I joined triple ten looking for a transition in my life, I&#39;ve dedicated my life to working in the construction field, grateful and proud of my job but I wanted to pursue my real passion, so I joined tripleten software engineering program with no experience programming at all, starting from the scratch to become a full stack engineer has been enormous growth in everything, from knowledge to personal. with flexible ways to complete the program even for the busiest person, and flexible funding plans as well.

I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22206542?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kristi I.</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I wanted to pursue QA engineering due to a passion for software cultivated from my previous job as a quality operations consultant for software in automated vehicles.

I wanted to gain proper guidance and mentorship in learning quality assurance, especially learning industry standards and best practices. I chose TripleTen due to outstanding reviews from various sites. I also perused the offers of career support, access to a community of aspiring learners, and externships. These offerings made TripleTen stand out for me, and ultimately, I chose TripleTen as my boot camp. Nearing the end of my learning journey, it is sufficient to say I do not regret choosing TripleTen one bit. I love the interactive learning platform with the various articles and activities to learn from. The projects were stellar, and I learned so much from the application. It was easy to get help from the staff, whether it be technical support or help in theory or projects. It was also fun to connect and learn with the other students in the Discord community. TripleTen offered an amazing educational experience, and I feel better equipped for the job search and career journey as a QA engineer.I would like to thank TripleTen and its staff for being amazing at what they do, and I am excited to continue my learning journey with them. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67807#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Dino Black</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started this program because I have a great passion for technology and storytelling.

I left the education field for software engineering and needed a program that would be fairly fast, thorough and affordable. I found all of those things in their SE program. Not including the time I took off, it... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it&#39;s been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67843#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sheena Irvin</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I ha... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>d a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen&#39;s features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined. Be sure that this is something you’d be passionate about- bc it won’t be easy. You will always be learning and will be challenged.

Let's be real, it's hard out there. It is definitely worth it. At first, it was rough, especially since I had no background on coding. My success manager made sure to reassure me that there are tools out there for help and pointed me in the right direction. There are tutors to help, fellow students, AI help, all you need is to bring your best intentions to succeed. I use the knowledge base section on the platform a lot to practice my skills. The recommended time per week to invest on your education is at least 10 hours. You can put in more work, if you have the time. I put in about 10-12 and still manage to maintain myself ahead. My only negative comment is that I am a visual learner, and a few of the chapters were harder on me, because I could not visualize the information provided. I do rely more on the workshops and AI to visualize the topics covered, as well as practice AD nauseum.

I booked a call and got to learn a lot about it, and I knew I had made the right choice. I started in TripleTen in mid October of last year and in the short time I've been a student I learned so much. I didn't just learn how to code but I learned time management, life balance, how to prioritize what's most important, and most importantly how to take care of myself and what matters to me. During my time at TripleTen I've unfortunately been sick a couple times in which the TripleTen team was extremely understanding and organized extensions and encouraged me to take time off if I ever needed it. The community is amazing, caring, and understanding. Success Managers, Tutors and other students are always ready to lend a hand whenever you need it. TripleTen is the right choice if you're looking for a place to embrace learning and learn from the very best. You get advice from real software engineers who will give you tips to pass your code reviews, while teaching you the best practices and making sure that you understand where the information comes from.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Claudia Gracia Licor"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Back in December 2023, I decided to leave a job where I was underpaid and over-stressed. I wanted to switch gears, and I wanted to work less on the front end (dealing with customers day in, day out) and work more behind the scenes. As I was looking around online for options, I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into the Business Intelligence Analytics program. Now, I am so thankful that I made the spur-of-the-moment decision to just... start. The courses are challenging enough to be fulfilling but not hard enough to make me want to pull my hair out. When it gets more difficult, there are numerous ways to find support, whether directly from a tutor or going through archived conversations within the community. The content is straightforward, the price is fair, the support staff is kind and knowledgeable, and the career advancement courses help make the job search feel structured and less intimidating. I'm very thankful I found this boot camp. I'm feeling a lot more competent, I have an increased sense of self-efficacy, I'm enjoying learning (I almost always do but this boot camp is easy to enjoy, and I'm making new connections through the community.

Yes, I knew coding, statistics, data collection, SQL and machine learning going into the program, but I soon discovered there are industry-specific libraries, frameworks, and practices that startups and tech companies want you to be versed in that I knew nothing about. I used to work in EdTech and have a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in Learning and Memory, so I can tell you their lesson and project scaffolding are unparalleled. You also learn in sprints, just like I did at my EdTech firm. What finally sold it for me was the job guarantee, their 87% hire rate (half of their students are hired before they graduate), and their flexible deadlines. I work as an actor and production manager while I complete TripleTen, and I wanted something that both held me to a rough schedule and that I could trust was flexible. My only issues thus far are some conflicting versions for some of the libraries we work with, and some typos in the assignment comments that are misleading. Still, the team at TripleTen is multinational and appears to constantly update their content to match current industry needs, so I forgive some failures of translation and misaligned tech libraries.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brian McElroy"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I wanted to pursue QA engineering due to a passion for software cultivated from my previous job as a quality operations consultant for software in automated vehicles. With such, I gained interest in ensuring that software can deliver expectations and beyond to its users. However, my previous job experience, while dipping into the domain of quality assurance, used specialized techniques and processes. I wanted to gain proper guidance and mentorship in learning quality assurance, especially learning industry standards and best practices. I chose TripleTen due to outstanding reviews from various sites. I also perused the offers of career support, access to a community of aspiring learners, and externships. These offerings made TripleTen stand out for me, and ultimately, I chose TripleTen as my boot camp. Nearing the end of my learning journey, it is sufficient to say I do not regret choosing TripleTen one bit. I love the interactive learning platform with the various articles and activities to learn from. The projects were stellar, and I learned so much from the application. It was easy to get help from the staff, whether it be technical support or help in theory or projects. It was also fun to connect and learn with the other students in the Discord community. TripleTen offered an amazing educational experience, and I feel better equipped for the job search and career journey as a QA engineer.I would like to thank TripleTen and its staff for being amazing at what they do, and I am excited to continue my learning journey with them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kristi I."},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-20T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started this program because I have a great passion for technology and storytelling.

So here I am, in this amazing bootcamp. Currently, I'm halfway through my business intelligence analytics program, and honestly, it's a great feeling. The program has been very interactive, filled with great theory and hands-on exercises that ultimately lead to projects. I highly recommend this program if you're looking for a chance to gain a new skillset and if you're looking for an opportunity to transition careers into the technology industry.

I left the education field for software engineering and needed a program that would be fairly fast, thorough and affordable. I found all of those things in their SE program. Not including the time I took off, it took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it's been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michaela Budde"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I had a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen's features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined. Be sure that this is something you’d be passionate about- bc it won’t be easy. You will always be learning and will be challenged.
