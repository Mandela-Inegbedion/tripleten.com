I originally was going to end up pursuing some sort of trade, but that ended up not being feasible so after months of looking around, I accidentally stumbled upon TripleTen (at that time Practicum) by way of a youtube ad. At this point in my ideas of careers to go into, tech didn&#39;t occur to me as I assumed I would need a degree to get into it, so it was out of the question in my mind, despite my interest in the field that I have had since I was a child. That however is not actually the case as I quickly learned when looking into TripleTen. After deliberating and considering some other similar boot camps for some time then, I decided to go with TripleTen, and I started their software engineering program in mid-June this year. Of the choices that I had, I have been thoroughly impressed and glad I decided to go with TripleTen. Every lesson, whether it be concerning CSS, HTML, Javascript, or a variety of other topics is very illuminating and helps a lot with the learning process. Each lesson (or sprint as it is called to mimic the field) contains a number of chapters, and each chapter contains within it a set of theory sections, as well as practice sections to accompany said theory sections. These lessons are very well designed, insofar as they avoid too much information while still being comprehensive. More often than not, these theory-practice pairs of lessons allow you to immediately put into use the things just learned, which I have found to be extremely helpful when it comes to the actual retention of the topics at hand. Each sprint (two weeks at least), at least in my case, takes anywhere from 40-60 hours to complete, depending upon how quickly you grasp the material and are able to put it to use. At the end of each sprint is contained a project which is a culmination of all of the learning you have learned up to that point. At the beginning of this program, the projects are largely guided, as it would be quite difficult to write a website knowing nothing. That being said though, as you learn quickly, the program begins to expect more of you offering less guidance as time goes on. That is not to say you are thrown into the deep end alone, as I will explain in greater detail the process of speaking with tutors momentarily.I think the thing which I like the most about the program so far is definitely the online platform I use to do the work that is required of me. It is exceptionally polished, and since I have joined the program in June, numerous different UI improvements have been made, as well as nice usage of AI when it comes to hints for each lessons work, which though a WIP which has its kinks, is largely an awesome addition. Second to the platform would be the extremely well organized discord and the very consistent and helpful staff that is part of it. Tutors are always ready to help, whether it be by forum posts, or by office hours. These tutors are always willing to assist with whatever problem you might have. I would get annoyed with myself and hesitate to ask what I would consider questions too easy to be worth asking, yet every time, the tutors who I would interact with always helped me to find answers, and were never impatient despite the times it has taken me more than I’d like to admit to solve problems even with their help. Additionally, there are events going on for career-prep, as well as other topics in the area of software-engineering. All-in-all, it makes for a very lively and helpful community. Thirdly and finally, the staff (success managers, guidance counselors, etc.) are all super helpful and kind people. At least once a sprint, my success manager has been reaching out to me individually to see how I am doing, what I may need help with, and whether I may be needing more time for a given project or not. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the TripleTen team.Starting with literally no knowledge at all, even just over the past five months, I have gone from being incapable of writing the most basic of things in HTML to now being capable of writing my own web app, which as I speak I am working on in a different window. I feel very well prepared so far in the program, and though I have certainly had my share of difficulties and frustrations (looking at you JavaScript), and I still have yet to reach the end of the program, as I am only about halfway through, the TripleTen team has given me confidence that I actually can learn and become proficient in these things as time goes on, and eventually be able to work in this field for a career.I couldn&#39;t recommend the program enough to anyone interested in the field. Easy 5 star rating from me.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Samuel Luo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1698609600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131828246?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=64194#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hi, my friends! How are you doing? One of our tutors likes to greet students in this way before his tutor hours on Discord.      Recently, some people around me asked me about how is my boot camp study so far. Actually, I was trying to give a specific talk about my journey, but I always stuck by the heavy and complicated projects on my hands. However, I am a person who likes to share good and positive things with people so that I want to tell my story here with you people.        It&#39;s time to give a review for TripleTen now. Truly, it’s definitely worths to choose for the people who want to start a career in the tech field today. Frankly, I think it&#39;s way better than my journey of CS in UTD.       It&#39;s been 7 months of studying at this bootcamp for its SE(software engineering) program, and I want to tell some real points that I have experienced from my Journey in Tripleten. First of all, we have a globe tutor team, which they could be in Russia, Germany, the U.S., or other countries while tutoring you. Because of this, you will be able to know different people and cultures behind them. Second, it has a very mature community system in Discord, there, students are divided by their study pace. For instance, I am currently studying on Sprint 8, so that I can only have access from the very beginning Demo project to Sprint 8. if you want to access the higher level Sprint, then you need to finish your current project successfully first, which means your project must be 100% qualified and then will be able to get approved by the reviewer team. Speaking of our reviewer team, I really want to send a big heart to them in person, because the strict process of review they had given me for each project shaped me to be a pro of SE gradually. Especially, the red comments and green comments guide me to realize my errors and how to improve my codes in a better way. In my impression, I still remember one of my projects which relates to the Responsive page of web development, the review stage took me 13 times to get approved at the end. 13 times, isn&#39;t it crazy? In the first 5 times, I was a little bit upset with the picky reviewers, but after reading on each of the comments they left below the errors, I started to sigh out in front of the computer, I definitely need these comments in my project, it helps me to identify that why my code is wrong and how I can improve it. Over time, I can see a big improvement in my code work, and it brings more confidence into my mind as well.  Third, it&#39;s the on-demand questions answered in Discord. Once you post your question in the corresponding channel, you will get an answer from one tutor or two tutors quickly. and this amazing part always makes me feel like we are in a real tutor room of a college where it has a bunch of tutors sitting there and eyes searching those confused students. Additionally, we also have a bunch of pretty and passionate female community managers who always plan some amazing events in the virtual community. like the co-work session time, it gathers those boring and lonely souls together from the end of the internet and hangs out in the virtual world where the study vibe is so joyful and contagious. Fourth, the professional lecture we are using covers the full-stack knowledge and tasks throughout Project 1 to the last Project 16. In the lecture, you will see the author explains those boring and cold knowledge points in a lighthearted and humorous way. And it also has lots of amazing illustrations within each of the chapters. Fifth, the career channel that in Discord is the place to teach those ongoing students and graduates how to work on their resumes and interviews, and make sure they are get ready to be hired after graduating. Finally, except above 5 points, I personally want to thank our community manager Olya, who always pays attention to each small step I have achieved. Toast me when I get approved of the project, and encourage me when I doubt myself on coding. Truly, she is so responsible and sweet in my heart.                  Lastly,  I want to tell you that I once an interior designer for over 10 years in the design field. After studying abroad in the U.S., I started to have a strong mind which told me to be an IT worker for the rest of my life here. Fortunately, I love everything about Coding and have so much passion for it every day. Indeed, not everyone likes to work with a computer every day.  Meanwhile, you may have some different voices around you to tell you that coding is too hard and boring, plus, it will be easily replaced by the AI and Chatgpt shortly. Actually, these are the same things I had worried about before. However, I still think the tech field will have a high demand in the future since everything in our surrounding are fully high-tech, which requires tech people more than any era in the past. By the way, there is a dram I want to share with you. It happened two months before I settled down with Tripleten. Back then, I chose a three -months boot camp, which was named Great Learning. The reason I chose it is because it has a partnership with UT at Austin, and also the program is cloud computing. However, the sense of experience is bad and makes me really upset with it. Finally, I quit the boot camp after the first month of study. The reason I quit has three fatal reasons. First, it’s an Indian-based boot camp, so that it has to take Zoom meetings in the morning every day to balance the time zone between U.S. and Indian; Second, the students and teachers have a heavy accent in which is extremely hard to understand completely. As we know the program itself is hard enough, and now their accent makes it harder than ever; Third,  the communication platform is WhatsApp, which is much unprofessional when compared to the Discord. Fourth, it lecture was full of pre-filmed videos, and it was hard to make me understand its concept as a complete beginner. Typically, it’s a self-taught lecture like others, all you can see from all of the videos is one Indian professor who works in UT at Austin McComb school as the lecture said. Overall, it’s really not for me. Based on my two times of boot camp experiences above, it should be a good reference to let people who are currently struggling with transitioning careers and choosing bootcamp.      In conclusion, if you want to make a good income, and remote work at home, without age anxiety, and socialize issues, then the tech field might be a good decision to make. All in all, the threshold of the Tech field is quite higher than other fields, and you need to keep learning new things in this field later on. Based on all of these above, if you are ready, then take action to do it. If you are interested in #Tripleten after reading over my sharing, pls feel free to ask me for a referral code, which will help you save a lot of money from the tuition.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tyler&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1698696000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After deciding to make a career switch, I began doing due diligence on multiple trade programs. After researching and narrowing down some options, I decided TripleTen was the best for me. While some programs were strict schedules, TripleTen&#39;s program was designed to be self-paced.The course itself is structured very well. They begin by teaching the fundamentals of Software Engineering to more advanced languages and practices through guided lessons, small exercises, and projects after each lesson.In addition to the lessons, they provide access to a Discord group that contains designated sub-groups for each lesson so that students can receive guidance on their tasks without getting lost in the larger group.The tutors, senior students, and community managers are all responsive to the questions asked and provide fantastic, in-depth responses. Between all the students, they really take the time to create an environment where individuals feel like they are receiving one-on-one attention.After reaching a certain point, career guidance becomes necessary. TripleTen provides access to phenomenal career guidance that offers tips and tricks to build the necessary tools to be a competitive job candidate.In addition to the many features listed, they also set up opportunities to participate in externships to gain experience in real world work settings.With TripleTen course, I can confidently say that I&#39;ve gained the skills to turn my ideas into reality.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jerry Jackson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1699128000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65492930d7eb3000126b3598/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was a self-taught software developer for over two decades. Over the years many languages and frameworks came into being but if they weren&#39;t useful at my current job I didn&#39;t bother learning them.During the pandemic, I was job searching when I saw a TripleTen ad for an online boot camp. Although I was skeptical, I realized I lacked some critical skills, specifically JavaScript and its frameworks. While I could edit JavaScript, I couldn&#39;t write original code due to my poor understanding. However, I didn&#39;t yet think TripleTen was the answer.Weeks later I once again came across TripleTen and this time I delved quite a bit deeper into the program. After talking to one of the career counselors I studied what other students who had gone through the program had to say about their time here. One by one my misgivings were satisfied by what I learned. Finally, I took out a loan and started the Full-Stack Software Engineer boot camp. I was still very skeptical, but promised myself to keep at it.Initially, I found the course easy, but struggled when we started the JavaScript lessons. My prior experience with other languages was, in fact, a hindrance and I found myself confused and frustrated. My Success &amp; Community Manager and tutors were incredibly supportive and patient, which helped me to eventually grasp the basics. Now, we have moved on to APIs and frameworks, and while there are still challenging concepts, the course is much easier than before.The interactive platform is pleasant for learning the theory behind each Sprint. It&#39;s easy to refer back to lessons and the visual cues for deadlines are helpful. The team adds new features to help students retain knowledge. The lessons start with the basics and build in stages. Sprint project submissions are reviewed by an engineer who points out errors and ways to improve. Getting a project accepted is a source of pride and reflects the real-world environment.The Discord community where we pose questions to our tutors and get help when we need it builds useful communication skills with a team that will be priceless to both the student and the company that hires them. This also allows other students to help with questions or issues; sometimes even before a tutor can answer. The camaraderie this builds makes for better developers in my view.Attending this boot camp while being unemployed, I can dedicate 25-30 hours every week to go through the material and the projects that follow each Sprint. This level of scheduling flexibility is very helpful for me to manage my time and plan my day. The tutors are available almost round the clock, and regular office hours are scheduled throughout the day and night. At the beginning of each Sprint&#39;s code project, I like to spend the first few hours mapping out tasks using the Pomodoro technique. This helps me to have a rough idea of the remaining work and which tasks have dependencies upon others. I have realized that proper time management is crucial for becoming a better programmer, and the Pomodoro technique has been very useful in enhancing my time management skills.Having career support as a feature of the boot camp is one of my favorite things about TripleTen. Writing resumes, cover letters, and doing interviews aren&#39;t as fun as coding, so those were always secondary in my mind. Having the help to make my skill set shine through to employers is a pretty awesome feeling for me. Networking is important in our field, but the introvert in a lot of us makes this one of the least desirable things on an individual level. TripleTen helped me ease past this and this alone will improve my odds of gainful employment doing something I love doing; I owe them my thanks for that.The Software Engineer program at TripleTen helped me become a much better Engineer than I was before my time here. I no longer dread many of the things I had incorrectly deemed unimportant or less than desirable. I&#39;m still not a people person, but I am improving those skills and the mindset I need to continue my journey as an Engineer and prosper.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Amira Laila Hadla Chomiak&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1699300800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m original a video editor and I had zero knowledge with programming at all. I decided to start a new career and found about Tripleten. I liked it because they offer a variety of programs that you can choose from, all online without any limitations. They provide a lot of theory so you can apply it in different projects, and you literally start from zero, which is great If you have no experience in this area. I feel that Tripleten Software engineer program has a very extensive learning path and it&#39;s easy to follow with the help of online tutors using discord (an online platform) to get in touch with everybody right when you need it. They have different groups where you can find out about the project you&#39;re working on, other people like you asking for help or giving help to others, interactive programs where you can participate, the career group, among other interesting things. The tutors are amazing, each one of them, the community managers are great (Thank you Olya), and also I should mention the online classmates are also very helpful. You can get in touch with tutors online besides discord, in zoom with live sessions where they help each of the students that join the live. It doesn&#39;t matter what project you&#39;re working on, they will help you find out how to solve the problem. Tripleten offers a career program that helps you build a first start for you to define what you want to do at the end of the program. If you&#39;re thinking about studying at Tripleten, I highly recommend doing the test where you can find out what program will fit best for you and just do it. Be organized, proactive and ask for help every time you need it. I hope to finish my program soon, I&#39;m very excited and looking forward to it :)&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anthony Ranieri&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1699473600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hi, my name is Anthony Ranieri and I am on the final project of Triple Ten&#39;s software engineering boot camp and I can&#39;t begin to tell you how amazing this program truly is. I fell in love with programming my senior year of high school and knew that this was the route to take. I was told about this boot camp from my cousin and he, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t able to take the program but heard great things about it and he passed it along to me. So, long story short I did some research and booked a meeting with one of Triple Ten&#39;s managers. I took the demo course and from the demo course alone I learned more in that week than I have before. They structure the lessons and projects so well. One of my favorite things about the course, in the learning aspect, was that it was not just material and words on a screen but after every lesson you got to do hands-on practicing making sure you understand it and are confident with it. But no worries if you are not because they have the best tutors in the world there if you are needed. Every tutor there helped me out tremendously when I needed it and they were happy to help and always understanding. One thing I can say is that they all have so much patience because I know there were times, especially looking back now, where I bet they wanted to say to me... \&quot;How do you not get it\&quot; or \&quot;I just told you this\&quot;. On top of all of this... the community managers are there if you need anything and they check in on you to make sure you are good or if you need anything at all. I can&#39;t rave enough about how amazing everyone is and how awesome the boot camp is itself. They have career coaches to help you land a job and help with interviews and get you ready for the next step. Almost being done with this boot camp I can tell you that I feel very confident in what I can do when it comes to programming. The amount of learning and knowledge I have retained from this boot camp is incredible and joining it was one of the best decisions of my life. I could go on forever about how awesome this boot camp is and how amazing all the tutors, managers and coaches are but you will never truly realize how awesome it is unless you take the course yourself. I completely encourage you too... they won&#39;t let you down!!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Chandra F&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1699473600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have no background in programming but I do have a Bachelor&#39;s in Marketing and have always been intrigued with the analytics side. With technology becoming the most efficient way to make analytical decisions, I figured it was time to start looking for a way to learn programming. After doing lots of research I decided to sign up for a call with TripleTen. After discussing the program features, the massive amounts of support provided and the career placement program, I knew TripleTen&#39;s Data Science program was the right choice for me.The program is broken up into Sprints which are made up of chapters, which are made up lessons. Each lesson features real work scenarios with tasks along the way. The project to complete after each Sprint helps to make sure you understand the material. After submitting your project, the reviewer provides great encouragement, tips and suggestions for future projects.As the material got harder, I felt as though I was falling behind. My community manager was able to set up a one-on-one with a tutor to help dive into the material I was struggling with. After our video chat I had a clearer picture on how the coding worked and was able to finish the program earlier than expected! I would definitely recommend this program.The best advice I can give someone thinking about getting into programming is to schedule your call with TripleTen. Ask all of the questions causing doubt in you mind and then start your journey to a better career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Twersky&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1699646400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to start learning data science to transition careers. I have a background in math but no coding experience and little by way of statistics. I chose TripleTen mainly because of their externship program and career and job search support, and 1 to 1 tutoring sessions. Towards the end of the bootcamp, DS students have the option of completing an externship. The data science bootcamp at TripleTen is mainly about what you put into it. The studying is mostly broken down into reading, with light problem sets and quizzes, as well as projects. The reading is dense and technical. It can often be hard to understand. I take notes as a read through each chapter. TripleTen encourages you to find answers on your own when you are struggling with a concept through recommended external resources. It moves quick and there is a lot of information. From coding to statistics to all the pertinent tools. The projects can be challenging but I find the 1:1 tutoring sessions to be very helpful. I have enjoyed interacting with some of the other students in the program through discord, zoom, and our study group as well as meeting some of the tutors on zoom. The industry Q&amp;A was particularly helpful. I don’t have anything to compare it to being the only bootcamp I have enrolled in. Despite the challenges of keeping up with the material, staying disciplined, and figuring out the projects, I have already learned way more then I ever knew about data science. My advice to anyone starting out is to stick with it, give it your all, and don&#39;t get discouraged.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alex&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1700078400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Going into this program, I thought I already knew most of what was being taught. I signed up mostly for the help finding a job after thinking youtube and other free videos was enough. I was pleasantly surprised with how much is provided for new students. There is always tutors available for questions and there is a lot of useful material provided. I had previously had a data analyst interview and I feel that if I had experienced this course before the interview, I would have had no problem getting the job. My favorite thing about the program is that the information you learn is all broken down into what they call \&quot;sprints\&quot;. This helps you stay organized with what you&#39;re learning and they can be completed early. At first, I was worried about the due dates. If you keep up with everything, it is not hard to end up far ahead of the due dates but they do provide the push needed to help people stick with it. This has been a great program to be a part of. If this is something you are considering, the biggest deciding factor for me was the money back guarantee if you don&#39;t find a job. Its a win-win scenario.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Daniel Matías Montañar Lobo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1700424000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After 9+ years of working at a few banks in NYC, I got pretty tired of what I was doing and wanted to switch careers -- the options were 1) an online bootcamp or 2) a master&#39;s degree. After speaking to a few family members for guidance (&#39;Googlers&#39; who mentioned good things about bootcamps) and weighing the cost of doing a Master&#39;s degree, I decided to go with option 1. &gt;&gt; Queue in TripleTen &lt;&lt;I chose to study Data Science through TripleTen (previously Practicum) after months of reviewing student reviews, online feedback and their programs/curriculums. Their part time bootcamp was ideal for me as I have a full-time job and the online platform looks/feels great and is intuitive; very easy to maneuver. And, in the last 8-9 months that I have been studying, they&#39;ve upgraded both the platform and some of the content which is great to see. Since I&#39;ve been years removed from any type of studying environment it was a little bit overwhelming at first trying to organize myself with hand written notes, reviewing online note taking options (too many options out there) and figuring out how many hours of my time to put into the sprints. What worked best for me as I near the bootcamp has been: 1) Note taking through Obsidian, 2) Going through a chapter w/o taking any notes then starting anew w/notes before moving on, and 3) not overthinking the amount of hours I put in (which was usually 1-2 a day). The DS projects have all been great, align to real-world scenarios/analyses and teach you a whole lot about the thinking process of data scientists. You have the option of running these on their platform or locally (highly recommend Kaggle). All the materials needed to complete the projects are covered in each sprint and the code reviewers are immensely helpful in giving you tips or tricks (I honestly learned quite a lot with the back and forth with my reviewers; shoutout to Dmitry!). While I didn&#39;t really leverage any of the community offerings like co-working hours, tutoring, workshops and/or specific sprint Q&amp;A (through Discord), it was great to know that if I hit any type of roadblock there are tons of options to find the answer to my problem. They also have a quite structured Career Prep/Accelerator program which was also one of the things that drew me in.Overall, I&#39;ve had an excellent experience with TripleTen, the community and getting to know the really cool things I can do as a Data Scientist in the future. *To those beginning their coding journey or the TripleTen program: it&#39;s okay to feel lost, it&#39;s okay to ask questions and we all ultimately suffer from the imposter syndrome.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alex Tribbey</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Over the past year since I graduated college in May, I have had a bit of turmoil determining what I was going to do for a job. I originally was going to end up pursuing some sort of trade, but that ended up not being feasible so after months of looking around, I accidentally stumbled upon TripleTen ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>(at that time Practicum) by way of a youtube ad. At this point in my ideas of careers to go into, tech didn&#39;t occur to me as I assumed I would need a degree to get into it, so it was out of the question in my mind, despite my interest in the field that I have had since I was a child. That however is not actually the case as I quickly learned when looking into TripleTen. After deliberating and considering some other similar boot camps for some time then, I decided to go with TripleTen, and I started their software engineering program in mid-June this year. Of the choices that I had, I have been thoroughly impressed and glad I decided to go with TripleTen. Every lesson, whether it be concerning CSS, HTML, Javascript, or a variety of other topics is very illuminating and helps a lot with the learning process. Each lesson (or sprint as it is called to mimic the field) contains a number of chapters, and each chapter contains within it a set of theory sections, as well as practice sections to accompany said theory sections. These lessons are very well designed, insofar as they avoid too much information while still being comprehensive. More often than not, these theory-practice pairs of lessons allow you to immediately put into use the things just learned, which I have found to be extremely helpful when it comes to the actual retention of the topics at hand. Each sprint (two weeks at least), at least in my case, takes anywhere from 40-60 hours to complete, depending upon how quickly you grasp the material and are able to put it to use. At the end of each sprint is contained a project which is a culmination of all of the learning you have learned up to that point. At the beginning of this program, the projects are largely guided, as it would be quite difficult to write a website knowing nothing. That being said though, as you learn quickly, the program begins to expect more of you offering less guidance as time goes on. That is not to say you are thrown into the deep end alone, as I will explain in greater detail the process of speaking with tutors momentarily.I think the thing which I like the most about the program so far is definitely the online platform I use to do the work that is required of me. It is exceptionally polished, and since I have joined the program in June, numerous different UI improvements have been made, as well as nice usage of AI when it comes to hints for each lessons work, which though a WIP which has its kinks, is largely an awesome addition. Second to the platform would be the extremely well organized discord and the very consistent and helpful staff that is part of it. Tutors are always ready to help, whether it be by forum posts, or by office hours. These tutors are always willing to assist with whatever problem you might have. I would get annoyed with myself and hesitate to ask what I would consider questions too easy to be worth asking, yet every time, the tutors who I would interact with always helped me to find answers, and were never impatient despite the times it has taken me more than I’d like to admit to solve problems even with their help. Additionally, there are events going on for career-prep, as well as other topics in the area of software-engineering. All-in-all, it makes for a very lively and helpful community. Thirdly and finally, the staff (success managers, guidance counselors, etc.) are all super helpful and kind people. At least once a sprint, my success manager has been reaching out to me individually to see how I am doing, what I may need help with, and whether I may be needing more time for a given project or not. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the TripleTen team.Starting with literally no knowledge at all, even just over the past five months, I have gone from being incapable of writing the most basic of things in HTML to now being capable of writing my own web app, which as I speak I am working on in a different window. I feel very well prepared so far in the program, and though I have certainly had my share of difficulties and frustrations (looking at you JavaScript), and I still have yet to reach the end of the program, as I am only about halfway through, the TripleTen team has given me confidence that I actually can learn and become proficient in these things as time goes on, and eventually be able to work in this field for a career.I couldn&#39;t recommend the program enough to anyone interested in the field. Easy 5 star rating from me. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131828246?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Samuel Luo</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Hi, my friends! How are you doing? One of our tutors likes to greet students in this way before his tutor hours on Discord.      Recently, some people around me asked me about how is my boot camp study so far. Actually, I was trying to give a specific talk about my journey, but I always stuck by the... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> heavy and complicated projects on my hands. However, I am a person who likes to share good and positive things with people so that I want to tell my story here with you people.        It&#39;s time to give a review for TripleTen now. Truly, it’s definitely worths to choose for the people who want to start a career in the tech field today. Frankly, I think it&#39;s way better than my journey of CS in UTD.       It&#39;s been 7 months of studying at this bootcamp for its SE(software engineering) program, and I want to tell some real points that I have experienced from my Journey in Tripleten. First of all, we have a globe tutor team, which they could be in Russia, Germany, the U.S., or other countries while tutoring you. Because of this, you will be able to know different people and cultures behind them. Second, it has a very mature community system in Discord, there, students are divided by their study pace. For instance, I am currently studying on Sprint 8, so that I can only have access from the very beginning Demo project to Sprint 8. if you want to access the higher level Sprint, then you need to finish your current project successfully first, which means your project must be 100% qualified and then will be able to get approved by the reviewer team. Speaking of our reviewer team, I really want to send a big heart to them in person, because the strict process of review they had given me for each project shaped me to be a pro of SE gradually. Especially, the red comments and green comments guide me to realize my errors and how to improve my codes in a better way. In my impression, I still remember one of my projects which relates to the Responsive page of web development, the review stage took me 13 times to get approved at the end. 13 times, isn&#39;t it crazy? In the first 5 times, I was a little bit upset with the picky reviewers, but after reading on each of the comments they left below the errors, I started to sigh out in front of the computer, I definitely need these comments in my project, it helps me to identify that why my code is wrong and how I can improve it. Over time, I can see a big improvement in my code work, and it brings more confidence into my mind as well.  Third, it&#39;s the on-demand questions answered in Discord. Once you post your question in the corresponding channel, you will get an answer from one tutor or two tutors quickly. and this amazing part always makes me feel like we are in a real tutor room of a college where it has a bunch of tutors sitting there and eyes searching those confused students. Additionally, we also have a bunch of pretty and passionate female community managers who always plan some amazing events in the virtual community. like the co-work session time, it gathers those boring and lonely souls together from the end of the internet and hangs out in the virtual world where the study vibe is so joyful and contagious. Fourth, the professional lecture we are using covers the full-stack knowledge and tasks throughout Project 1 to the last Project 16. In the lecture, you will see the author explains those boring and cold knowledge points in a lighthearted and humorous way. And it also has lots of amazing illustrations within each of the chapters. Fifth, the career channel that in Discord is the place to teach those ongoing students and graduates how to work on their resumes and interviews, and make sure they are get ready to be hired after graduating. Finally, except above 5 points, I personally want to thank our community manager Olya, who always pays attention to each small step I have achieved. Toast me when I get approved of the project, and encourage me when I doubt myself on coding. Truly, she is so responsible and sweet in my heart.                  Lastly,  I want to tell you that I once an interior designer for over 10 years in the design field. After studying abroad in the U.S., I started to have a strong mind which told me to be an IT worker for the rest of my life here. Fortunately, I love everything about Coding and have so much passion for it every day. Indeed, not everyone likes to work with a computer every day.  Meanwhile, you may have some different voices around you to tell you that coding is too hard and boring, plus, it will be easily replaced by the AI and Chatgpt shortly. Actually, these are the same things I had worried about before. However, I still think the tech field will have a high demand in the future since everything in our surrounding are fully high-tech, which requires tech people more than any era in the past. By the way, there is a dram I want to share with you. It happened two months before I settled down with Tripleten. Back then, I chose a three -months boot camp, which was named Great Learning. The reason I chose it is because it has a partnership with UT at Austin, and also the program is cloud computing. However, the sense of experience is bad and makes me really upset with it. Finally, I quit the boot camp after the first month of study. The reason I quit has three fatal reasons. First, it’s an Indian-based boot camp, so that it has to take Zoom meetings in the morning every day to balance the time zone between U.S. and Indian; Second, the students and teachers have a heavy accent in which is extremely hard to understand completely. As we know the program itself is hard enough, and now their accent makes it harder than ever; Third,  the communication platform is WhatsApp, which is much unprofessional when compared to the Discord. Fourth, it lecture was full of pre-filmed videos, and it was hard to make me understand its concept as a complete beginner. Typically, it’s a self-taught lecture like others, all you can see from all of the videos is one Indian professor who works in UT at Austin McComb school as the lecture said. Overall, it’s really not for me. Based on my two times of boot camp experiences above, it should be a good reference to let people who are currently struggling with transitioning careers and choosing bootcamp.      In conclusion, if you want to make a good income, and remote work at home, without age anxiety, and socialize issues, then the tech field might be a good decision to make. All in all, the threshold of the Tech field is quite higher than other fields, and you need to keep learning new things in this field later on. Based on all of these above, if you are ready, then take action to do it. If you are interested in #Tripleten after reading over my sharing, pls feel free to ask me for a referral code, which will help you save a lot of money from the tuition. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=64194#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tyler</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>After deciding to make a career switch, I began doing due diligence on multiple trade programs. After researching and narrowing down some options, I decided TripleTen was the best for me. While some programs were strict schedules, TripleTen&#39;s program was designed to be self-paced.The course itself i... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>s structured very well. They begin by teaching the fundamentals of Software Engineering to more advanced languages and practices through guided lessons, small exercises, and projects after each lesson.In addition to the lessons, they provide access to a Discord group that contains designated sub-groups for each lesson so that students can receive guidance on their tasks without getting lost in the larger group.The tutors, senior students, and community managers are all responsive to the questions asked and provide fantastic, in-depth responses. Between all the students, they really take the time to create an environment where individuals feel like they are receiving one-on-one attention.After reaching a certain point, career guidance becomes necessary. TripleTen provides access to phenomenal career guidance that offers tips and tricks to build the necessary tools to be a competitive job candidate.In addition to the many features listed, they also set up opportunities to participate in externships to gain experience in real world work settings.With TripleTen course, I can confidently say that I&#39;ve gained the skills to turn my ideas into reality. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/65492930d7eb3000126b3598/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jerry Jackson</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I was a self-taught software developer for over two decades. Over the years many languages and frameworks came into being but if they weren&#39;t useful at my current job I didn&#39;t bother learning them.During the pandemic, I was job searching when I saw a TripleTen ad for an online boot camp. Although I ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>was skeptical, I realized I lacked some critical skills, specifically JavaScript and its frameworks. While I could edit JavaScript, I couldn&#39;t write original code due to my poor understanding. However, I didn&#39;t yet think TripleTen was the answer.Weeks later I once again came across TripleTen and this time I delved quite a bit deeper into the program. After talking to one of the career counselors I studied what other students who had gone through the program had to say about their time here. One by one my misgivings were satisfied by what I learned. Finally, I took out a loan and started the Full-Stack Software Engineer boot camp. I was still very skeptical, but promised myself to keep at it.Initially, I found the course easy, but struggled when we started the JavaScript lessons. My prior experience with other languages was, in fact, a hindrance and I found myself confused and frustrated. My Success &amp; Community Manager and tutors were incredibly supportive and patient, which helped me to eventually grasp the basics. Now, we have moved on to APIs and frameworks, and while there are still challenging concepts, the course is much easier than before.The interactive platform is pleasant for learning the theory behind each Sprint. It&#39;s easy to refer back to lessons and the visual cues for deadlines are helpful. The team adds new features to help students retain knowledge. The lessons start with the basics and build in stages. Sprint project submissions are reviewed by an engineer who points out errors and ways to improve. Getting a project accepted is a source of pride and reflects the real-world environment.The Discord community where we pose questions to our tutors and get help when we need it builds useful communication skills with a team that will be priceless to both the student and the company that hires them. This also allows other students to help with questions or issues; sometimes even before a tutor can answer. The camaraderie this builds makes for better developers in my view.Attending this boot camp while being unemployed, I can dedicate 25-30 hours every week to go through the material and the projects that follow each Sprint. This level of scheduling flexibility is very helpful for me to manage my time and plan my day. The tutors are available almost round the clock, and regular office hours are scheduled throughout the day and night. At the beginning of each Sprint&#39;s code project, I like to spend the first few hours mapping out tasks using the Pomodoro technique. This helps me to have a rough idea of the remaining work and which tasks have dependencies upon others. I have realized that proper time management is crucial for becoming a better programmer, and the Pomodoro technique has been very useful in enhancing my time management skills.Having career support as a feature of the boot camp is one of my favorite things about TripleTen. Writing resumes, cover letters, and doing interviews aren&#39;t as fun as coding, so those were always secondary in my mind. Having the help to make my skill set shine through to employers is a pretty awesome feeling for me. Networking is important in our field, but the introvert in a lot of us makes this one of the least desirable things on an individual level. TripleTen helped me ease past this and this alone will improve my odds of gainful employment doing something I love doing; I owe them my thanks for that.The Software Engineer program at TripleTen helped me become a much better Engineer than I was before my time here. I no longer dread many of the things I had incorrectly deemed unimportant or less than desirable. I&#39;m still not a people person, but I am improving those skills and the mindset I need to continue my journey as an Engineer and prosper. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Amira Laila Hadla Chomiak</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;m original a video editor and I had zero knowledge with programming at all.

They provide a lot of theory so you can apply it ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>in different projects, and you literally start from zero, which is great If you have no experience in this area. I feel that Tripleten Software engineer program has a very extensive learning path and it&#39;s easy to follow with the help of online tutors using discord (an online platform) to get in touch with everybody right when you need it. They have different groups where you can find out about the project you&#39;re working on, other people like you asking for help or giving help to others, interactive programs where you can participate, the career group, among other interesting things. The tutors are amazing, each one of them, the community managers are great (Thank you Olya), and also I should mention the online classmates are also very helpful. You can get in touch with tutors online besides discord, in zoom with live sessions where they help each of the students that join the live. It doesn&#39;t matter what project you&#39;re working on, they will help you find out how to solve the problem. Tripleten offers a career program that helps you build a first start for you to define what you want to do at the end of the program. If you&#39;re thinking about studying at Tripleten, I highly recommend doing the test where you can find out what program will fit best for you and just do it. Be organized, proactive and ask for help every time you need it. I hope to finish my program soon, I&#39;m very excited and looking forward to it :) </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anthony Ranieri</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Hi, my name is Anthony Ranieri and I am on the final project of Triple Ten&#39;s software engineering boot camp and I can&#39;t begin to tell you how amazing this program truly is. I fell in love with programming my senior year of high school and knew that this was the route to take. I was told about this b... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>oot camp from my cousin and he, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t able to take the program but heard great things about it and he passed it along to me. So, long story short I did some research and booked a meeting with one of Triple Ten&#39;s managers. I took the demo course and from the demo course alone I learned more in that week than I have before. They structure the lessons and projects so well. One of my favorite things about the course, in the learning aspect, was that it was not just material and words on a screen but after every lesson you got to do hands-on practicing making sure you understand it and are confident with it. But no worries if you are not because they have the best tutors in the world there if you are needed. Every tutor there helped me out tremendously when I needed it and they were happy to help and always understanding. One thing I can say is that they all have so much patience because I know there were times, especially looking back now, where I bet they wanted to say to me... &quot;How do you not get it&quot; or &quot;I just told you this&quot;. On top of all of this... the community managers are there if you need anything and they check in on you to make sure you are good or if you need anything at all. I can&#39;t rave enough about how amazing everyone is and how awesome the boot camp is itself. They have career coaches to help you land a job and help with interviews and get you ready for the next step. Almost being done with this boot camp I can tell you that I feel very confident in what I can do when it comes to programming. The amount of learning and knowledge I have retained from this boot camp is incredible and joining it was one of the best decisions of my life. I could go on forever about how awesome this boot camp is and how amazing all the tutors, managers and coaches are but you will never truly realize how awesome it is unless you take the course yourself. I completely encourage you too... they won&#39;t let you down!! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Chandra F</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I have no background in programming but I do have a Bachelor&#39;s in Marketing and have always been intrigued with the analytics side.

After discussing the program features, the massive amounts of support provided and the career placement program, I knew TripleTen&#39;s Data Science program was the right choice for me.The program is broken up into Sprints which are made up of chapters, which are made up lessons. Each lesson features real work scenarios with tasks along the way. The project to complete after each Sprint helps to make sure you understand the material. After submitting your project, the reviewer provides great encouragement, tips and suggestions for future projects.As the material got harder, I felt as though I was falling behind. My community manager was able to set up a one-on-one with a tutor to help dive into the material I was struggling with. After our video chat I had a clearer picture on how the coding worked and was able to finish the program earlier than expected! I would definitely recommend this program.The best advice I can give someone thinking about getting into programming is to schedule your call with TripleTen. Ask all of the questions causing doubt in you mind and then start your journey to a better career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michael Twersky</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I decided to start learning data science to transition careers.

The data science bootcamp at TripleTen is mainly about what you put into it. The studying is mostly broken down into reading, with light problem sets and quizzes, as well as projects. The reading is dense and technical. It can often be hard to understand. I take notes as a read through each chapter. TripleTen encourages you to find answers on your own when you are struggling with a concept through recommended external resources. It moves quick and there is a lot of information. From coding to statistics to all the pertinent tools. The projects can be challenging but I find the 1:1 tutoring sessions to be very helpful. I have enjoyed interacting with some of the other students in the program through discord, zoom, and our study group as well as meeting some of the tutors on zoom. The industry Q&amp;A was particularly helpful. I don’t have anything to compare it to being the only bootcamp I have enrolled in. Despite the challenges of keeping up with the material, staying disciplined, and figuring out the projects, I have already learned way more then I ever knew about data science. My advice to anyone starting out is to stick with it, give it your all, and don&#39;t get discouraged. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alex</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Going into this program, I thought I already knew most of what was being taught.

I had previously had a data analyst interview and I feel that if I had experienced this course before the interview, I would have had no problem getting the job. My favorite thing about the program is that the information you learn is all broken down into what they call &quot;sprints&quot;. This helps you stay organized with what you&#39;re learning and they can be completed early. At first, I was worried about the due dates. If you keep up with everything, it is not hard to end up far ahead of the due dates but they do provide the push needed to help people stick with it. This has been a great program to be a part of. If this is something you are considering, the biggest deciding factor for me was the money back guarantee if you don&#39;t find a job.

After speaking to a few family members for guidance (&#39;Googlers&#39; who mentioned good things about bootcamps) and weigh... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ing the cost of doing a Master&#39;s degree, I decided to go with option 1. &gt;&gt; Queue in TripleTen &lt;&lt;I chose to study Data Science through TripleTen (previously Practicum) after months of reviewing student reviews, online feedback and their programs/curriculums. Their part time bootcamp was ideal for me as I have a full-time job and the online platform looks/feels great and is intuitive; very easy to maneuver. And, in the last 8-9 months that I have been studying, they&#39;ve upgraded both the platform and some of the content which is great to see. Since I&#39;ve been years removed from any type of studying environment it was a little bit overwhelming at first trying to organize myself with hand written notes, reviewing online note taking options (too many options out there) and figuring out how many hours of my time to put into the sprints. What worked best for me as I near the bootcamp has been: 1) Note taking through Obsidian, 2) Going through a chapter w/o taking any notes then starting anew w/notes before moving on, and 3) not overthinking the amount of hours I put in (which was usually 1-2 a day). The DS projects have all been great, align to real-world scenarios/analyses and teach you a whole lot about the thinking process of data scientists. You have the option of running these on their platform or locally (highly recommend Kaggle). All the materials needed to complete the projects are covered in each sprint and the code reviewers are immensely helpful in giving you tips or tricks (I honestly learned quite a lot with the back and forth with my reviewers; shoutout to Dmitry!). While I didn&#39;t really leverage any of the community offerings like co-working hours, tutoring, workshops and/or specific sprint Q&amp;A (through Discord), it was great to know that if I hit any type of roadblock there are tons of options to find the answer to my problem. They also have a quite structured Career Prep/Accelerator program which was also one of the things that drew me in.Overall, I&#39;ve had an excellent experience with TripleTen, the community and getting to know the really cool things I can do as a Data Scientist in the future. *To those beginning their coding journey or the TripleTen program: it&#39;s okay to feel lost, it&#39;s okay to ask questions and we all ultimately suffer from the imposter syndrome. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../11/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../11/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>11</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>12</span></a><a href="../13/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>13</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../13/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-10-24T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Over the past year since I graduated college in May, I have had a bit of turmoil determining what I was going to do for a job. I originally was going to end up pursuing some sort of trade, but that ended up not being feasible so after months of looking around, I accidentally stumbled upon TripleTen (at that time Practicum) by way of a youtube ad. At this point in my ideas of careers to go into, tech didn't occur to me as I assumed I would need a degree to get into it, so it was out of the question in my mind, despite my interest in the field that I have had since I was a child. That however is not actually the case as I quickly learned when looking into TripleTen. After deliberating and considering some other similar boot camps for some time then, I decided to go with TripleTen, and I started their software engineering program in mid-June this year. Of the choices that I had, I have been thoroughly impressed and glad I decided to go with TripleTen. Every lesson, whether it be concerning CSS, HTML, Javascript, or a variety of other topics is very illuminating and helps a lot with the learning process. Each lesson (or sprint as it is called to mimic the field) contains a number of chapters, and each chapter contains within it a set of theory sections, as well as practice sections to accompany said theory sections. These lessons are very well designed, insofar as they avoid too much information while still being comprehensive. More often than not, these theory-practice pairs of lessons allow you to immediately put into use the things just learned, which I have found to be extremely helpful when it comes to the actual retention of the topics at hand. Each sprint (two weeks at least), at least in my case, takes anywhere from 40-60 hours to complete, depending upon how quickly you grasp the material and are able to put it to use. At the end of each sprint is contained a project which is a culmination of all of the learning you have learned up to that point. At the beginning of this program, the projects are largely guided, as it would be quite difficult to write a website knowing nothing. That being said though, as you learn quickly, the program begins to expect more of you offering less guidance as time goes on. That is not to say you are thrown into the deep end alone, as I will explain in greater detail the process of speaking with tutors momentarily.I think the thing which I like the most about the program so far is definitely the online platform I use to do the work that is required of me. It is exceptionally polished, and since I have joined the program in June, numerous different UI improvements have been made, as well as nice usage of AI when it comes to hints for each lessons work, which though a WIP which has its kinks, is largely an awesome addition. Second to the platform would be the extremely well organized discord and the very consistent and helpful staff that is part of it. Tutors are always ready to help, whether it be by forum posts, or by office hours. These tutors are always willing to assist with whatever problem you might have. I would get annoyed with myself and hesitate to ask what I would consider questions too easy to be worth asking, yet every time, the tutors who I would interact with always helped me to find answers, and were never impatient despite the times it has taken me more than I’d like to admit to solve problems even with their help. Additionally, there are events going on for career-prep, as well as other topics in the area of software-engineering. All-in-all, it makes for a very lively and helpful community. Thirdly and finally, the staff (success managers, guidance counselors, etc.) are all super helpful and kind people. At least once a sprint, my success manager has been reaching out to me individually to see how I am doing, what I may need help with, and whether I may be needing more time for a given project or not. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the TripleTen team.Starting with literally no knowledge at all, even just over the past five months, I have gone from being incapable of writing the most basic of things in HTML to now being capable of writing my own web app, which as I speak I am working on in a different window. I feel very well prepared so far in the program, and though I have certainly had my share of difficulties and frustrations (looking at you JavaScript), and I still have yet to reach the end of the program, as I am only about halfway through, the TripleTen team has given me confidence that I actually can learn and become proficient in these things as time goes on, and eventually be able to work in this field for a career.I couldn't recommend the program enough to anyone interested in the field. Easy 5 star rating from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alex Tribbey"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-10-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Hi, my friends! How are you doing? One of our tutors likes to greet students in this way before his tutor hours on Discord.      Recently, some people around me asked me about how is my boot camp study so far. Actually, I was trying to give a specific talk about my journey, but I always stuck by the heavy and complicated projects on my hands. However, I am a person who likes to share good and positive things with people so that I want to tell my story here with you people.        It's time to give a review for TripleTen now. Truly, it’s definitely worths to choose for the people who want to start a career in the tech field today. Frankly, I think it's way better than my journey of CS in UTD.       It's been 7 months of studying at this bootcamp for its SE(software engineering) program, and I want to tell some real points that I have experienced from my Journey in Tripleten. First of all, we have a globe tutor team, which they could be in Russia, Germany, the U.S., or other countries while tutoring you. Because of this, you will be able to know different people and cultures behind them. Second, it has a very mature community system in Discord, there, students are divided by their study pace. For instance, I am currently studying on Sprint 8, so that I can only have access from the very beginning Demo project to Sprint 8. if you want to access the higher level Sprint, then you need to finish your current project successfully first, which means your project must be 100% qualified and then will be able to get approved by the reviewer team. Speaking of our reviewer team, I really want to send a big heart to them in person, because the strict process of review they had given me for each project shaped me to be a pro of SE gradually. Especially, the red comments and green comments guide me to realize my errors and how to improve my codes in a better way. In my impression, I still remember one of my projects which relates to the Responsive page of web development, the review stage took me 13 times to get approved at the end. 13 times, isn't it crazy? In the first 5 times, I was a little bit upset with the picky reviewers, but after reading on each of the comments they left below the errors, I started to sigh out in front of the computer, I definitely need these comments in my project, it helps me to identify that why my code is wrong and how I can improve it. Over time, I can see a big improvement in my code work, and it brings more confidence into my mind as well.  Third, it's the on-demand questions answered in Discord. Once you post your question in the corresponding channel, you will get an answer from one tutor or two tutors quickly. and this amazing part always makes me feel like we are in a real tutor room of a college where it has a bunch of tutors sitting there and eyes searching those confused students. Additionally, we also have a bunch of pretty and passionate female community managers who always plan some amazing events in the virtual community. like the co-work session time, it gathers those boring and lonely souls together from the end of the internet and hangs out in the virtual world where the study vibe is so joyful and contagious. Fourth, the professional lecture we are using covers the full-stack knowledge and tasks throughout Project 1 to the last Project 16. In the lecture, you will see the author explains those boring and cold knowledge points in a lighthearted and humorous way. And it also has lots of amazing illustrations within each of the chapters. Fifth, the career channel that in Discord is the place to teach those ongoing students and graduates how to work on their resumes and interviews, and make sure they are get ready to be hired after graduating. Finally, except above 5 points, I personally want to thank our community manager Olya, who always pays attention to each small step I have achieved. Toast me when I get approved of the project, and encourage me when I doubt myself on coding. Truly, she is so responsible and sweet in my heart.                  Lastly,  I want to tell you that I once an interior designer for over 10 years in the design field. After studying abroad in the U.S., I started to have a strong mind which told me to be an IT worker for the rest of my life here. Fortunately, I love everything about Coding and have so much passion for it every day. Indeed, not everyone likes to work with a computer every day.  Meanwhile, you may have some different voices around you to tell you that coding is too hard and boring, plus, it will be easily replaced by the AI and Chatgpt shortly. Actually, these are the same things I had worried about before. However, I still think the tech field will have a high demand in the future since everything in our surrounding are fully high-tech, which requires tech people more than any era in the past. By the way, there is a dram I want to share with you. It happened two months before I settled down with Tripleten. Back then, I chose a three -months boot camp, which was named Great Learning. The reason I chose it is because it has a partnership with UT at Austin, and also the program is cloud computing. However, the sense of experience is bad and makes me really upset with it. Finally, I quit the boot camp after the first month of study. The reason I quit has three fatal reasons. First, it’s an Indian-based boot camp, so that it has to take Zoom meetings in the morning every day to balance the time zone between U.S. and Indian; Second, the students and teachers have a heavy accent in which is extremely hard to understand completely. As we know the program itself is hard enough, and now their accent makes it harder than ever; Third,  the communication platform is WhatsApp, which is much unprofessional when compared to the Discord. Fourth, it lecture was full of pre-filmed videos, and it was hard to make me understand its concept as a complete beginner. Typically, it’s a self-taught lecture like others, all you can see from all of the videos is one Indian professor who works in UT at Austin McComb school as the lecture said. Overall, it’s really not for me. Based on my two times of boot camp experiences above, it should be a good reference to let people who are currently struggling with transitioning careers and choosing bootcamp.      In conclusion, if you want to make a good income, and remote work at home, without age anxiety, and socialize issues, then the tech field might be a good decision to make. All in all, the threshold of the Tech field is quite higher than other fields, and you need to keep learning new things in this field later on. Based on all of these above, if you are ready, then take action to do it. If you are interested in #Tripleten after reading over my sharing, pls feel free to ask me for a referral code, which will help you save a lot of money from the tuition.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Samuel Luo"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-10-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After deciding to make a career switch, I began doing due diligence on multiple trade programs. After researching and narrowing down some options, I decided TripleTen was the best for me. While some programs were strict schedules, TripleTen's program was designed to be self-paced.The course itself is structured very well. They begin by teaching the fundamentals of Software Engineering to more advanced languages and practices through guided lessons, small exercises, and projects after each lesson.In addition to the lessons, they provide access to a Discord group that contains designated sub-groups for each lesson so that students can receive guidance on their tasks without getting lost in the larger group.The tutors, senior students, and community managers are all responsive to the questions asked and provide fantastic, in-depth responses. Between all the students, they really take the time to create an environment where individuals feel like they are receiving one-on-one attention.After reaching a certain point, career guidance becomes necessary. TripleTen provides access to phenomenal career guidance that offers tips and tricks to build the necessary tools to be a competitive job candidate.In addition to the many features listed, they also set up opportunities to participate in externships to gain experience in real world work settings.With TripleTen course, I can confidently say that I've gained the skills to turn my ideas into reality.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tyler"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-04T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I was a self-taught software developer for over two decades. Over the years many languages and frameworks came into being but if they weren't useful at my current job I didn't bother learning them.During the pandemic, I was job searching when I saw a TripleTen ad for an online boot camp. Although I was skeptical, I realized I lacked some critical skills, specifically JavaScript and its frameworks. While I could edit JavaScript, I couldn't write original code due to my poor understanding. However, I didn't yet think TripleTen was the answer.Weeks later I once again came across TripleTen and this time I delved quite a bit deeper into the program. After talking to one of the career counselors I studied what other students who had gone through the program had to say about their time here. One by one my misgivings were satisfied by what I learned. Finally, I took out a loan and started the Full-Stack Software Engineer boot camp. I was still very skeptical, but promised myself to keep at it.Initially, I found the course easy, but struggled when we started the JavaScript lessons. My prior experience with other languages was, in fact, a hindrance and I found myself confused and frustrated. My Success & Community Manager and tutors were incredibly supportive and patient, which helped me to eventually grasp the basics. Now, we have moved on to APIs and frameworks, and while there are still challenging concepts, the course is much easier than before.The interactive platform is pleasant for learning the theory behind each Sprint. It's easy to refer back to lessons and the visual cues for deadlines are helpful. The team adds new features to help students retain knowledge. The lessons start with the basics and build in stages. Sprint project submissions are reviewed by an engineer who points out errors and ways to improve. Getting a project accepted is a source of pride and reflects the real-world environment.The Discord community where we pose questions to our tutors and get help when we need it builds useful communication skills with a team that will be priceless to both the student and the company that hires them. This also allows other students to help with questions or issues; sometimes even before a tutor can answer. The camaraderie this builds makes for better developers in my view.Attending this boot camp while being unemployed, I can dedicate 25-30 hours every week to go through the material and the projects that follow each Sprint. This level of scheduling flexibility is very helpful for me to manage my time and plan my day. The tutors are available almost round the clock, and regular office hours are scheduled throughout the day and night. At the beginning of each Sprint's code project, I like to spend the first few hours mapping out tasks using the Pomodoro technique. This helps me to have a rough idea of the remaining work and which tasks have dependencies upon others. I have realized that proper time management is crucial for becoming a better programmer, and the Pomodoro technique has been very useful in enhancing my time management skills.Having career support as a feature of the boot camp is one of my favorite things about TripleTen. Writing resumes, cover letters, and doing interviews aren't as fun as coding, so those were always secondary in my mind. Having the help to make my skill set shine through to employers is a pretty awesome feeling for me. Networking is important in our field, but the introvert in a lot of us makes this one of the least desirable things on an individual level. TripleTen helped me ease past this and this alone will improve my odds of gainful employment doing something I love doing; I owe them my thanks for that.The Software Engineer program at TripleTen helped me become a much better Engineer than I was before my time here. I no longer dread many of the things I had incorrectly deemed unimportant or less than desirable. I'm still not a people person, but I am improving those skills and the mindset I need to continue my journey as an Engineer and prosper.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jerry Jackson"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I'm original a video editor and I had zero knowledge with programming at all. I decided to start a new career and found about Tripleten. I liked it because they offer a variety of programs that you can choose from, all online without any limitations. They provide a lot of theory so you can apply it in different projects, and you literally start from zero, which is great If you have no experience in this area. I feel that Tripleten Software engineer program has a very extensive learning path and it's easy to follow with the help of online tutors using discord (an online platform) to get in touch with everybody right when you need it. They have different groups where you can find out about the project you're working on, other people like you asking for help or giving help to others, interactive programs where you can participate, the career group, among other interesting things. The tutors are amazing, each one of them, the community managers are great (Thank you Olya), and also I should mention the online classmates are also very helpful. You can get in touch with tutors online besides discord, in zoom with live sessions where they help each of the students that join the live. It doesn't matter what project you're working on, they will help you find out how to solve the problem. Tripleten offers a career program that helps you build a first start for you to define what you want to do at the end of the program. If you're thinking about studying at Tripleten, I highly recommend doing the test where you can find out what program will fit best for you and just do it. Be organized, proactive and ask for help every time you need it. I hope to finish my program soon, I'm very excited and looking forward to it :)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amira Laila Hadla Chomiak"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-08T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Hi, my name is Anthony Ranieri and I am on the final project of Triple Ten's software engineering boot camp and I can't begin to tell you how amazing this program truly is. I fell in love with programming my senior year of high school and knew that this was the route to take. I was told about this boot camp from my cousin and he, unfortunately, wasn't able to take the program but heard great things about it and he passed it along to me. So, long story short I did some research and booked a meeting with one of Triple Ten's managers. I took the demo course and from the demo course alone I learned more in that week than I have before. They structure the lessons and projects so well. One of my favorite things about the course, in the learning aspect, was that it was not just material and words on a screen but after every lesson you got to do hands-on practicing making sure you understand it and are confident with it. But no worries if you are not because they have the best tutors in the world there if you are needed. Every tutor there helped me out tremendously when I needed it and they were happy to help and always understanding. One thing I can say is that they all have so much patience because I know there were times, especially looking back now, where I bet they wanted to say to me... \"How do you not get it\" or \"I just told you this\". On top of all of this... the community managers are there if you need anything and they check in on you to make sure you are good or if you need anything at all. I can't rave enough about how amazing everyone is and how awesome the boot camp is itself. They have career coaches to help you land a job and help with interviews and get you ready for the next step. Almost being done with this boot camp I can tell you that I feel very confident in what I can do when it comes to programming. The amount of learning and knowledge I have retained from this boot camp is incredible and joining it was one of the best decisions of my life. I could go on forever about how awesome this boot camp is and how amazing all the tutors, managers and coaches are but you will never truly realize how awesome it is unless you take the course yourself. I completely encourage you too... they won't let you down!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anthony Ranieri"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-08T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have no background in programming but I do have a Bachelor's in Marketing and have always been intrigued with the analytics side. With technology becoming the most efficient way to make analytical decisions, I figured it was time to start looking for a way to learn programming. After doing lots of research I decided to sign up for a call with TripleTen. After discussing the program features, the massive amounts of support provided and the career placement program, I knew TripleTen's Data Science program was the right choice for me.The program is broken up into Sprints which are made up of chapters, which are made up lessons. Each lesson features real work scenarios with tasks along the way. The project to complete after each Sprint helps to make sure you understand the material. After submitting your project, the reviewer provides great encouragement, tips and suggestions for future projects.As the material got harder, I felt as though I was falling behind. My community manager was able to set up a one-on-one with a tutor to help dive into the material I was struggling with. After our video chat I had a clearer picture on how the coding worked and was able to finish the program earlier than expected! I would definitely recommend this program.The best advice I can give someone thinking about getting into programming is to schedule your call with TripleTen. Ask all of the questions causing doubt in you mind and then start your journey to a better career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chandra F"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I decided to start learning data science to transition careers. I have a background in math but no coding experience and little by way of statistics. I chose TripleTen mainly because of their externship program and career and job search support, and 1 to 1 tutoring sessions. Towards the end of the bootcamp, DS students have the option of completing an externship. The data science bootcamp at TripleTen is mainly about what you put into it. The studying is mostly broken down into reading, with light problem sets and quizzes, as well as projects. The reading is dense and technical. It can often be hard to understand. I take notes as a read through each chapter. TripleTen encourages you to find answers on your own when you are struggling with a concept through recommended external resources. It moves quick and there is a lot of information. From coding to statistics to all the pertinent tools. The projects can be challenging but I find the 1:1 tutoring sessions to be very helpful. I have enjoyed interacting with some of the other students in the program through discord, zoom, and our study group as well as meeting some of the tutors on zoom. The industry Q&A was particularly helpful. I don’t have anything to compare it to being the only bootcamp I have enrolled in. Despite the challenges of keeping up with the material, staying disciplined, and figuring out the projects, I have already learned way more then I ever knew about data science. My advice to anyone starting out is to stick with it, give it your all, and don't get discouraged.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Twersky"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-15T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Going into this program, I thought I already knew most of what was being taught. I signed up mostly for the help finding a job after thinking youtube and other free videos was enough. I was pleasantly surprised with how much is provided for new students. There is always tutors available for questions and there is a lot of useful material provided. I had previously had a data analyst interview and I feel that if I had experienced this course before the interview, I would have had no problem getting the job. My favorite thing about the program is that the information you learn is all broken down into what they call \"sprints\". This helps you stay organized with what you're learning and they can be completed early. At first, I was worried about the due dates. If you keep up with everything, it is not hard to end up far ahead of the due dates but they do provide the push needed to help people stick with it. This has been a great program to be a part of. If this is something you are considering, the biggest deciding factor for me was the money back guarantee if you don't find a job. Its a win-win scenario.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alex"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-11-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After 9+ years of working at a few banks in NYC, I got pretty tired of what I was doing and wanted to switch careers -- the options were 1) an online bootcamp or 2) a master's degree. After speaking to a few family members for guidance ('Googlers' who mentioned good things about bootcamps) and weighing the cost of doing a Master's degree, I decided to go with option 1. >> Queue in TripleTen <<I chose to study Data Science through TripleTen (previously Practicum) after months of reviewing student reviews, online feedback and their programs/curriculums. Their part time bootcamp was ideal for me as I have a full-time job and the online platform looks/feels great and is intuitive; very easy to maneuver. And, in the last 8-9 months that I have been studying, they've upgraded both the platform and some of the content which is great to see. Since I've been years removed from any type of studying environment it was a little bit overwhelming at first trying to organize myself with hand written notes, reviewing online note taking options (too many options out there) and figuring out how many hours of my time to put into the sprints. What worked best for me as I near the bootcamp has been: 1) Note taking through Obsidian, 2) Going through a chapter w/o taking any notes then starting anew w/notes before moving on, and 3) not overthinking the amount of hours I put in (which was usually 1-2 a day). The DS projects have all been great, align to real-world scenarios/analyses and teach you a whole lot about the thinking process of data scientists. You have the option of running these on their platform or locally (highly recommend Kaggle). All the materials needed to complete the projects are covered in each sprint and the code reviewers are immensely helpful in giving you tips or tricks (I honestly learned quite a lot with the back and forth with my reviewers; shoutout to Dmitry!). While I didn't really leverage any of the community offerings like co-working hours, tutoring, workshops and/or specific sprint Q&A (through Discord), it was great to know that if I hit any type of roadblock there are tons of options to find the answer to my problem. They also have a quite structured Career Prep/Accelerator program which was also one of the things that drew me in.Overall, I've had an excellent experience with TripleTen, the community and getting to know the really cool things I can do as a Data Scientist in the future. *To those beginning their coding journey or the TripleTen program: it's okay to feel lost, it's okay to ask questions and we all ultimately suffer from the imposter syndrome.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Matías Montañar Lobo"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
