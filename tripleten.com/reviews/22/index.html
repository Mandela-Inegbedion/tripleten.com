So I switched careers and joined the software path I wanted. Although I joined the career I wanted, I felt that I wasn&#39;t in a continuous path of learning, there was nothing concrete nor continuity on any technology I was learning. While pursuing my associate&#39;s degree in software I tried different bootcamps from different platforms to experience what I really liked, until I found out that I loved web development. But again, didn&#39;t finish the course.Tripleten was the final tool that allowed me to become a software engineer. I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you&#39;re trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I&#39;ve done in my life.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anonymous&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709755200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67543#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career. Currently on Sprint 9 of 16, the journey has been tough yet fulfilling. Overall, TripleTen impresses with its supportive community, responsive tutors, and comprehensive curriculum, starting with basics like HTML/CSS and advancing to JavaScript.

Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to learn more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.\nThe website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.\nI chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. \nI love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. \nOne of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!\nI have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Fatema J Honey&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710100800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65efa3688dae0f0012902e59/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I really like the bootcamp. it is different than any other bootcamp i have participated before. it forces me to understand and write codes while studying at my own pace. it makes everything really fun by giving small simple tasks which is challenging but very informative.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Omer T Butt&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710100800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67590#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Embarking on the path of data science was a decision spurred by my fascination with uncovering insights from data and making informed decisions. As the digital landscape evolves, the demand for data-driven solutions grows exponentially, and I saw learning data science as not just a skill but a necessity for navigating this data-rich world.Upon researching various bootcamps, TripleTen stood out for its comprehensive curriculum, dedicated learning platform, and robust community support.

However, in 2023, I felt the need for a change and began exploring alternative career paths. After careful consideration, I realized that coding could be an excellent choice for my future.Despite being 42 years old, I decided to embrace this new challenge. My search for the best coding school led me to TripleTen, an online bootcamp. Since joining in March 2023, my journey has been nothing short of remarkable. The support I receive from the TripleTen team has been invaluable.Coding can be daunting, but the TripleTen team makes it significantly more manageable. Their round-the-clock availability of tutors aligns perfectly with my schedule, and their responsiveness is commendable. Whenever I need assistance, they promptly address my queries.I wholeheartedly recommend TripleTen to anyone interested in learning coding. This experience has enriched my knowledge base significantly, and I am proud of the substantial progress I’ve made in understanding this intricate field.Thank you, TripleTen, for this incredible journey!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Natasha Bagramian&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710187200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67604#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I just graduated from the program and I am fully satisfied with everything I learned. I came to the QA program not knowing much, and I definitely gained valuable skills for the job. I appreciated that there were 9 different projects to work on, I was able to practice everything (from testing fundamentals to test automation). The fact that I couldn&#39;t get away with doing just bare minimum was great, project reviewers didn&#39;t just look at my project, but paid attention to every detail and send my projects back to improve, so I have a full confidence that people who graduate from TripleTen know how to do things, they didn&#39;t just click through the slides. When I had questions, I was able to ask tutors for help - that was nice. The course materials could be confusing sometimes, sometimes I felt lost, but when I got to the projects- I actually was able to figure things out. It was definitely helpful that I studied JavaScript before. I am not sure if the course materials were enough to understand what&#39;s going on with JavaScript if you are a beginner. But I am sure that even beginners could get enough help from tutors. If you feel stuck- you can always talk to your success manager - they will help you out. I can&#39;t imagine a situation when a student is told \&quot;well, figure it out on your own\&quot;. What&#39;s was also important for me is the ability to participate in some kind of real world projects and I was at first skeptical that TripleTen would offer one - I thought it was just marketing. But no... I put my name in the waitlist and I have an externship scheduled for April!!! So that&#39;s cool. Because we know it&#39;s hard to get experience when you have no experience. Career support and coaching is great. I haven&#39;t fully finished the career portion of the program, but they give you so much support since day one, so I have zero doubts that I will be helped.So, overall, I am very happy with my decision to join the program. Definitely was worth the money. I plan on developing more skills and learning more stuff for sure, otherwise it&#39;s really hard to compete with others. But TripleTen is a great start.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Quashawn L Melton&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710187200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67607#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen has been a rewarding experience for me. When I was first looking for something different to do in a career, I researched a lot of different bootcamps. I honestly didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I had been wanting something that would give me access to work remote and have flexible hours, I have a daughter that I love to spend time with. I came across TripleTen by an Ad on IG. I decided to look more into it. Originally, I was going to take the Business Analytics course as I have been a Finance Manager before and it was only 4 months. After taking the quiz I realized Data Science was the way to go. Over the past few months, it has been challenging but very rewarding. I love the interactive platforms; the projects are hard BUT the access to previous questions asked by other graduates and tutors makes completing the task doable. I am a few projects from finishing, and I cannot wait to see what I can get next. I recommend this to my friends any chance I get. If I could give advice to anyone, I would say don’t give up and if you don’t know, ASK. Someone is always willing to provide help when needed.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sara Kaempf&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710360000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67639#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Nearing the end of 2023, I found myself growing increasingly disheartened by the trajectory of my career as a Social Worker. While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn&#39;t see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn&#39;t sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen&#39;s website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program&#39;s commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.\nI can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I&#39;ve been fully supported in the process. When I&#39;m working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer&#39;s feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I&#39;d say run, don&#39;t walk! I wholeheartedly recommend taking the leap. Just be aware, it&#39;s essential to approach this journey with a growth-mindset, as the work is no cake walk. Embracing challenges is the mechanism to personal and professional growth in any field.

But again, didn&#39;t finish the course.Tripleten was the final tool that allowed me to become a software engineer. I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you&#39;re trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I&#39;ve done in my life. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67537#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anonymous</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career.

Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to lear... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>n more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.
The website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.
I chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. 
I love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. 
One of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!
I have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67556#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/65efa3688dae0f0012902e59/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Fatema J Honey</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I really like the bootcamp. it is different than any other bootcamp i have participated before. it forces me to understand and write codes while studying at my own pace. it makes everything really fun by giving small simple tasks which is challenging but very informative. </span><!----><!----></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Omer T Butt</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Embarking on the path of data science was a decision spurred by my fascination with uncovering insights from data and making informed decisions.

I came to the QA program not knowing much, and I definitely gained valuable skills for the job. I appreciated that there were 9 different projects to work on, I was able to practice everything (from testing fundame... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ntals to test automation). The fact that I couldn&#39;t get away with doing just bare minimum was great, project reviewers didn&#39;t just look at my project, but paid attention to every detail and send my projects back to improve, so I have a full confidence that people who graduate from TripleTen know how to do things, they didn&#39;t just click through the slides. When I had questions, I was able to ask tutors for help - that was nice. The course materials could be confusing sometimes, sometimes I felt lost, but when I got to the projects- I actually was able to figure things out. It was definitely helpful that I studied JavaScript before. I am not sure if the course materials were enough to understand what&#39;s going on with JavaScript if you are a beginner. But I am sure that even beginners could get enough help from tutors. If you feel stuck- you can always talk to your success manager - they will help you out. I can&#39;t imagine a situation when a student is told &quot;well, figure it out on your own&quot;. What&#39;s was also important for me is the ability to participate in some kind of real world projects and I was at first skeptical that TripleTen would offer one - I thought it was just marketing. But no... I put my name in the waitlist and I have an externship scheduled for April!!! So that&#39;s cool. Because we know it&#39;s hard to get experience when you have no experience. Career support and coaching is great. I haven&#39;t fully finished the career portion of the program, but they give you so much support since day one, so I have zero doubts that I will be helped.So, overall, I am very happy with my decision to join the program. Definitely was worth the money. I plan on developing more skills and learning more stuff for sure, otherwise it&#39;s really hard to compete with others. But TripleTen is a great start. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67604#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Quashawn L Melton</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen has been a rewarding experience for me.

I love the interactive platforms; the projects are hard BUT the access to previous questions asked by other graduates and tutors makes completing the task doable. I am a few projects from finishing, and I cannot wait to see what I can get next. I recommend this to my friends any chance I get.

While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn&#39;t see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn&#39;t sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen&#39;s website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program&#39;s commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.
I can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I&#39;ve been fully supported in the process. When I&#39;m working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer&#39;s feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I&#39;d say run, don&#39;t walk!

So I switched careers and joined the software path I wanted. Although I joined the career I wanted, I felt that I wasn't in a continuous path of learning, there was nothing concrete nor continuity on any technology I was learning. While pursuing my associate's degree in software I tried different bootcamps from different platforms to experience what I really liked, until I found out that I loved web development. But again, didn't finish the course.Tripleten was the final tool that allowed me to become a software engineer. I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you're trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I've done in my life.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Angel Baez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career.

Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to learn more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.\nThe website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.\nI chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. \nI love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. \nOne of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!\nI have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charmaine Locsin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I really like the bootcamp. it is different than any other bootcamp i have participated before. it forces me to understand and write codes while studying at my own pace. it makes everything really fun by giving small simple tasks which is challenging but very informative.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fatema J Honey"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Embarking on the path of data science was a decision spurred by my fascination with uncovering insights from data and making informed decisions.

I came to the QA program not knowing much, and I definitely gained valuable skills for the job. I appreciated that there were 9 different projects to work on, I was able to practice everything (from testing fundamentals to test automation). The fact that I couldn't get away with doing just bare minimum was great, project reviewers didn't just look at my project, but paid attention to every detail and send my projects back to improve, so I have a full confidence that people who graduate from TripleTen know how to do things, they didn't just click through the slides. When I had questions, I was able to ask tutors for help - that was nice. The course materials could be confusing sometimes, sometimes I felt lost, but when I got to the projects- I actually was able to figure things out. It was definitely helpful that I studied JavaScript before. I am not sure if the course materials were enough to understand what's going on with JavaScript if you are a beginner. But I am sure that even beginners could get enough help from tutors. If you feel stuck- you can always talk to your success manager - they will help you out. I can't imagine a situation when a student is told \"well, figure it out on your own\". What's was also important for me is the ability to participate in some kind of real world projects and I was at first skeptical that TripleTen would offer one - I thought it was just marketing. But no... I put my name in the waitlist and I have an externship scheduled for April!!! So that's cool. Because we know it's hard to get experience when you have no experience. Career support and coaching is great. I haven't fully finished the career portion of the program, but they give you so much support since day one, so I have zero doubts that I will be helped.So, overall, I am very happy with my decision to join the program. Definitely was worth the money. I plan on developing more skills and learning more stuff for sure, otherwise it's really hard to compete with others. But TripleTen is a great start.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Natasha Bagramian"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen has been a rewarding experience for me.

After taking the quiz I realized Data Science was the way to go. Over the past few months, it has been challenging but very rewarding. I love the interactive platforms; the projects are hard BUT the access to previous questions asked by other graduates and tutors makes completing the task doable. I am a few projects from finishing, and I cannot wait to see what I can get next. I recommend this to my friends any chance I get.

While I love Social Work and have a lot of respect for the field, I came to accept I didn't see myself being fulfilled in a long-term career as a Social Worker. In my dismay, I brainstormed what else I might do, as I had already made a major career switch from the Fashion Industry to Social Work, and now... I wasn't sure! What I did know, is that I want a career in which I can channel my wide array of skills, that translates across industries, and makes a tangible impact. Weirdly enough, I also have a side gig doing data entry, and as cheesy as it sounds, I have developed a serious appreciation for a well-kept database. I started searching ways to combine my desire to solve gaps with my enthusiasm for data so that I could find a way to once again feel energized by my work, and like I was making a difference. A simple web search led me to TripleTen's website, where I discovered an array of data-focused paths. The BI Analyst program immediately resonated with me, especially given the glowing reviews and the program's commitment to helping you find a job in your chosen program. That gave me all the confidence I needed to enroll.\nI can confidently say that my learning journey has exceeded my initial expectations. As someone balancing two jobs with a career transition, the self-paced format of the course has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the suggested timeline in the learning platform for completing lessons has been crucial in holding me accountable to stay on track. While the projects have been challenging, especially for a beginner like myself, I appreciate the opportunity they afford me to gain the critical skills I need for my career goals. And, I've been fully supported in the process. When I'm working at 11pm and run into an obstacle, the readily available assistance on Discord and recorded workshops have been instrumental in helping me move through the program. The lesson activities reflect real-life business problems, so I feel like I am gaining the insight needed to not only perform the technical tasks but demonstrate to a recruiter I know how to anticipate and solve business problems. Additionally, the applications used in the BI Analyst program match up with the experience requirements for all the jobs I see. The code reviewer's feedback on my projects has also given me confidence that I am becoming competent in these skills. Moreover, my success manager has been proactive in making sure I receive the full value of the program by regularly checking in, addressing questions/concerns, connecting me to the right resources, and discussing my career goals. I truly feel that the TripleTen team cares about my success. Even in an online environment, there is sense of camaraderie among the network of professionals and students associated with TripleTen. I can clearly see their collective passion for the data field and eagerness to support aspiring data professionals. To anyone considering in TripleTen, I'd say run, don't walk! I wholeheartedly recommend taking the leap. Just be aware, it's essential to approach this journey with a growth-mindset, as the work is no cake walk. Embracing challenges is the mechanism to personal and professional growth in any field. I found that to be true in Fashion, Social Work, and now the vast world of Data!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sara Kaempf"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
