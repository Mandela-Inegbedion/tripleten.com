I was intrigued and wanted to know more about their programs so I joined TripleTen’s webinar that same day and I was convinced that this is what I wanted to do. After doing some research on which program is best suitable for me, I decided on Quality Assurance. An advisor reached out to me and provided more details on the QA program and I became even more confident that this was the right decision. I enrolled in February and fast forward to today (July), I have officially completed the program!! If you’re having doubts, I’d say just do it! You’ll be done in no time! The materials provided in the course is through the TripleTen’s platform and it is well-structured and designed for students to work on their own pace. They’ve also included a chat support through the platform just in case you have to ask any questions. Aside from chat support, they also have an engaging community dedicated to QA on Discord so you never feel stuck or alone. If I had to recommend TripleTen to my family and friends, I would without a doubt!

I owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated tutors and supportive success managers who played a pivotal role in guiding me through challenges and keeping me on track. Their unwavering assistance propelled me toward my goal, and I deeply value their kindness and expertise. With this certification in hand, I am eager to apply my newfound skills meaningfully in the field of web development.During my final sprint, which presented significant challenges, I often found myself at a crossroads unsure of the next steps. It was during this critical phase that Kevin Loughead stood out, dedicating ample time to help me navigate complexities. His guidance was instrumental in clarifying the parameters required for controllers and frontend integration. Moreover, Kevin&#39;s expertise extended to refactoring backend models, streamlining data accessibility.One standout experience was working together on an application utilizing OpenAI&#39;s API. Kevin not only taught me how to effectively manipulate objects and arrays within my frontend functions but also collaborated on enhancing backend models for easier data retrieval. This personalized support was invaluable, highlighting TripleTen&#39;s commitment to nurturing practical skills and ensuring success in real-world applications.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Judith&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1721246400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I recently completed a program where I learned incredible skills that I know will greatly benefit me in my future career endeavors. Throughout the entire journey, my success manager, Denis, was an invaluable asset. From the initial stages right through to the end, Denis was consistently responsive and supportive, promptly addressing any questions or concerns I had. His dedication and guidance made a significant difference in my experience, ensuring that I felt supported every step of the way.

I had never taken any coding and online training. TripleTen offer flexible learning schedule. TripleTen providing real-world simulations. Real-world projects enrich learning and build portfolios. The course offers learning experience in sprints which is very helpful to become more proficient in delivering projects on time and achieving success in your endeavour . The information is easy to understand and can be immediately applied to tasks and projects.The course gives you a good base and the tools as you need. The Team is friendly , supportive as well as knowledgeable . They have a lot of practical experience in what they teach. You actually get to interact with them, and they are ready to help and always available to answer your questions.The career services provided by TripleTen, such as resume reviews and interview preparation, have been invaluable in preparing me for the job marketDefinitely recommend TripleTen to anyone interested getting into tech.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;SAUMYA NAYAK&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1722024000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I realized after working for a few years in well-paying, but rather plain teaching job, that I needed the challenge and pace that only a career in tech could give me, so I looked into Development. The program was very self paced with constant new information that forced you to keep up and work hard. I choose Triple Ten because it is giving enough long duration to complete course work which is needed for me as am new in tech world. Plus there is lot of support and guidance from the tutors if we stuck in between projects or have any doubts we can reach them at any time on the platform Discord. The instructors are very knowledgeable and very helpful.For me, the most challenging part was adapting some of the unique libraries and technologies that were presented throughout the course. The core concept is there, but this was the first “bump” I came across. An example here would be various JavaScript libraries; you have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript, but understanding/adapting a unique JS library while initially only abstracting parts of it is something that takes time. The important lesson I learned here is that this is a common challenge for even seasoned developers, as the industry is variable and constantly changing with new/different/better ways to do things, so it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that it may take you time to learn something. It reinforced my opinion that you are never too old to learn something new! It was pretty amazing going from not knowing how to code to building a real working project. Then there is career support which is great benefit and our ultimate goal to land a desired job. This program gave me knowledge of Technologies which were new for me and confidence to kickstart my career in tech industry. So if you are passionate about technologies and interested in putting efforts then this would be a good fit for you.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Janeika&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1722283200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was really nervous about being this journey but everyone that I’ve encountered in my time at TripleTen has been very reassuring and patient with me. I’ve had to have extensions on some of my Sprint Projects and is was never an issue to get one. Some of the projects were a little difficult for me but the tutors that I have worked with are wonderful (special shoutout to Tiffany). I believe that the skills I’ve learned through the months I have spent at TripleTen are valuable skills and will help me on my journey to becoming a successful Business Intelligence Analyst.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Maria Plutman&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1722283200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=71169#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I found the Data Analyst course at TripleTen at the perfect time for me, as I was eager to break into the IT industry.

The course equipped me with a wealth of knowledge, and working on real projects made me feel confident in my skills.The flexibility of the course was ideal for someone with a full-time job, allowing me to manage my time effectively. Anastasia, my instructor, was exceptional—she was always available to help when I struggled with projects and provided a lot of additional insights during the weekly webinars.Additionally, the career accelerator course led by Irina and Matat was invaluable. It played a crucial role in helping me take the first steps toward my dream job. Their guidance and support were instrumental in navigating the job market and preparing for interviews.Overall, I highly recommend both the Data Analyst course and the career accelerator to anyone looking to advance in the IT field.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ahmad Hijazi&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started this data science journey to transition into an exciting new field from engineering. I compared several boot camps before selecting TripleTen and it was the best fit for me due to the flexible study schedule, breadth of the curriculum, continuous support from the community managers &amp; tutors, and affordability.\nTripleTen&#39;s comprehensive data science program has helped me learn Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, Git, and machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised for classification and regression tasks. \nEven though support is readily available from tutors during office hours and quick-to-respond community managers, I encourage you to challenge yourself and not ask for help until you&#39;ve tried as this will make the solution more rewarding and memorable.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alex Louis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;When I was first looking for a new job, I thought I knew everything. After learning what I could find on YouTube, I thought I could tackle any problem. The job market definitely humbled me... I started searching for other ways that could help me and came across Tripleten. I was very hesitant about paying but the money-back guarantee swayed me. The course was very involved but the structure it provided helped more than words can say. There is multiple modules all focusing on different technical skills, as well as tips on other skills that can help like presenting and keeping productive. The best part about the course though was not the technical knowledge, it was the career help. Tripleten is with you every step of the way in helping you find a job. They provide a coach dedicated to helping you succeed. The part I found most beneficial was mock interviews. I look back and cringe at my performance in interviews before having feedback that helped me improve. I ended the program and it did take a while to get a job, but I did get one.

I was intrigued and wanted to know more about their programs so I joined TripleTen’s webinar that same day and I was convinced that this is what I wanted to do. After doing some research on which pr... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ogram is best suitable for me, I decided on Quality Assurance. An advisor reached out to me and provided more details on the QA program and I became even more confident that this was the right decision. I enrolled in February and fast forward to today (July), I have officially completed the program!! If you’re having doubts, I’d say just do it! You’ll be done in no time! The materials provided in the course is through the TripleTen’s platform and it is well-structured and designed for students to work on their own pace. They’ve also included a chat support through the platform just in case you have to ask any questions. Aside from chat support, they also have an engaging community dedicated to QA on Discord so you never feel stuck or alone. If I had to recommend TripleTen to my family and friends, I would without a doubt! Thank you for a wonderful experience that I will never forget! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70877#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Joshua James</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>My experience at TripleTen has been truly transformative, culminating in my certification as a full-stack developer.

It was during this critical phase that Kevin Loughead stood out, dedicating ample time to help me navigate complexities. His guidance was instrumental in clarifying the parameters required for controllers and frontend integration. Moreover, Kevin&#39;s expertise extended to refactoring backend models, streamlining data accessibility.One standout experience was working together on an application utilizing OpenAI&#39;s API. Kevin not only taught me how to effectively manipulate objects and arrays within my frontend functions but also collaborated on enhancing backend models for easier data retrieval.

Plus there is lot of support and guidance from the tutors if we stuck in between projects or have any doubts we can reach them at any time on the platform Discord. The instructors are very knowledgeable and very helpful.For me, the most challenging part was adapting some of the unique libraries and technologies that were presented throughout the course. The core concept is there, but this was the first “bump” I came across. An example here would be various JavaScript libraries; you have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript, but understanding/adapting a unique JS library while initially only abstracting parts of it is something that takes time. The important lesson I learned here is that this is a common challenge for even seasoned developers, as the industry is variable and constantly changing with new/different/better ways to do things, so it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that it may take you time to learn something. It reinforced my opinion that you are never too old to learn something new! It was pretty amazing going from not knowing how to code to building a real working project. Then there is career support which is great benefit and our ultimate goal to land a desired job. This program gave me knowledge of Technologies which were new for me and confidence to kickstart my career in tech industry. So if you are passionate about technologies and interested in putting efforts then this would be a good fit for you. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Janeika</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I was really nervous about being this journey but everyone that I’ve encountered in my time at TripleTen has been very reassuring and patient with me.

I was intrigued and wanted to know more about their programs so I joined TripleTen’s webinar that same day and I was convinced that this is what I wanted to do. After doing some research on which program is best suitable for me, I decided on Quality Assurance. An advisor reached out to me and provided more details on the QA program and I became even more confident that this was the right decision. I enrolled in February and fast forward to today (July), I have officially completed the program!! If you’re having doubts, I’d say just do it! You’ll be done in no time! The materials provided in the course is through the TripleTen’s platform and it is well-structured and designed for students to work on their own pace. They’ve also included a chat support through the platform just in case you have to ask any questions. Aside from chat support, they also have an engaging community dedicated to QA on Discord so you never feel stuck or alone. If I had to recommend TripleTen to my family and friends, I would without a doubt!

I owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated tutors and supportive success managers who played a pivotal role in guiding me through challenges and keeping me on track. Their unwavering assistance propelled me toward my goal, and I deeply value their kindness and expertise. With this certification in hand, I am eager to apply my newfound skills meaningfully in the field of web development.During my final sprint, which presented significant challenges, I often found myself at a crossroads unsure of the next steps. It was during this critical phase that Kevin Loughead stood out, dedicating ample time to help me navigate complexities. His guidance was instrumental in clarifying the parameters required for controllers and frontend integration. Moreover, Kevin's expertise extended to refactoring backend models, streamlining data accessibility.One standout experience was working together on an application utilizing OpenAI's API. Kevin not only taught me how to effectively manipulate objects and arrays within my frontend functions but also collaborated on enhancing backend models for easier data retrieval. This personalized support was invaluable, highlighting TripleTen's commitment to nurturing practical skills and ensuring success in real-world applications.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joshua James"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I recently completed a program where I learned incredible skills that I know will greatly benefit me in my future career endeavors.

The program was very self paced with constant new information that forced you to keep up and work hard. I choose Triple Ten because it is giving enough long duration to complete course work which is needed for me as am new in tech world. Plus there is lot of support and guidance from the tutors if we stuck in between projects or have any doubts we can reach them at any time on the platform Discord. The instructors are very knowledgeable and very helpful.For me, the most challenging part was adapting some of the unique libraries and technologies that were presented throughout the course. The core concept is there, but this was the first “bump” I came across. An example here would be various JavaScript libraries; you have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript, but understanding/adapting a unique JS library while initially only abstracting parts of it is something that takes time. The important lesson I learned here is that this is a common challenge for even seasoned developers, as the industry is variable and constantly changing with new/different/better ways to do things, so it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that it may take you time to learn something. It reinforced my opinion that you are never too old to learn something new! It was pretty amazing going from not knowing how to code to building a real working project. Then there is career support which is great benefit and our ultimate goal to land a desired job. This program gave me knowledge of Technologies which were new for me and confidence to kickstart my career in tech industry. So if you are passionate about technologies and interested in putting efforts then this would be a good fit for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"SAUMYA NAYAK"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I was really nervous about being this journey but everyone that I’ve encountered in my time at TripleTen has been very reassuring and patient with me.
