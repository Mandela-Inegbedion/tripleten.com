I did not come into this program as fresh as some people are due to me having an Associates in Computer Programming and currently working in a IT Support role but there were still some fun and challenging sections. What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Allen&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1704398400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65907#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve always been interested in tech, but never knew where to start. After doing research on different bootcamps, I decided to commit to TripleTen. I loved how they offered a platform with other students and tutors to help guide me on my journey of becoming a QA Engineer. They offer a ton of resources and real guidance on how to properly execute each sprint. I am currently a part-time student who works a full-time job. TripleTen does a great job with assisting students on sprints, projects, and honestly anything else you as a student may need! One of my favorite features of this bootcamp was the interactive platform, and Discord community. Being familiar with Discord helped me navigate each sprint along with correlating projects and any resources the tutors and students posted. Everyone in TripleTen is honestly so helpful and personable. I feel confident and comfortable with reaching out for help whenever it is needed. There&#39;s no better feeling than getting a project approved and continuing to learn. It has been an incredible journey thus far. Thank you TripleTen!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jadin D Pauling&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705694400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66324#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After having some experience in the tech field and being rebounded by warehouse work, I wanted to take more steps into the field that interested me and move past average customer support and desktop/smartphone support. After doing some digging and research to find my next move to make this happen. I was advertised to \&quot;Tripleten\&quot; on a social media feed. However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I&#39;ve been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn&#39;t my tutors &amp; community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I&#39;ve spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks &amp; help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there&#39;s even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir &amp; Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I&#39;m confident once I&#39;m done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I&#39;ve encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF&#39;s and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there&#39;s already been good changes made and I&#39;m on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There&#39;s no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others \&quot;5 Stars&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Carlos Sierra&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705953600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65b061d56f7c8a0012c3c1e3/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen was just a spontaneous decision spurred from an Instagram ad during a time of uncertainty in my career. It has been a great decision and a better challenge for myself, pushing to achieve things I didn&#39;t think I could accomplish while working a full-time career. The staff for TripleTen have been extremely accommodating, supportive, and most importantly... knowledgeable! I recommend going through either of their programs if you feel, like I did myself, that you could&#39;ve/should&#39;ve gone down a tech-centered career path. It is never too late to make a positive change knowing there&#39;s a support system there to push you to your final goals!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sayuri Yamamoto Shamray&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1706126400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Last year I decided to change my career, I was looking for something that I could do from home. I worked so many years on sight, I just want the tranquility of my home. I started to look for courses that could give me that freedom, and then I found Tripleten. I had an experience one by one over the phone and I decided that it would be something pleasant to learn. The price was very accessible and It worked for me. You just need to have some time available to study 2 or 3 hours a day, some people are more disciplined, but trust me, I&#39;m not one of them and it still works for me. The support I have from the tutors are awesome, and always when you need help, we have a app called Discord that you can type your issue and somebody will help you anytime, or tutors, or senior students, its wonderful. There are career assistance and LinkedIn assistance also. Don&#39;t think just because is online that you not going to interact with other students, we had a meeting very nice over the zoom and was fun to meet and chat with others. Coming back to the course, they provide high quality material and activities, it worth a lot if you like me is looking to change your career. I would be lying if I tell that it&#39;s easy, because is not, you need to put a lot of effort to make it happen, read the material, and if you need, read it again and again.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Svetlana Kubatina&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1708632000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67196#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Like many here, I started learning QA engineering to change my career path.\n\nI chose TripleTen because it&#39;s the only bootcamp with its platform, developed by authors who are active QA engineers, editors, designers, and career consultants. This isn&#39;t just recorded webinars offered by other bootcamps. I especially liked this because I absorb information better in text than audibly, as my English level isn&#39;t high enough to catch everything on the fly.\n\nMoreover, I was attracted by their promise to refund the tuition if I didn&#39;t find a job within six months after the training. This sounded confident from their side, so I realized that the primary goal of this bootcamp was to prepare me for a QA engineer position.\n\nAnother advantage over other schools is the flexible payment system for the course. I couldn&#39;t afford to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month like other bootcamps demanded, unlike TripleTen, where I could take a two-year installment plan.\n\nAs I expected, TripleTen pleased me with its interactive learning platform. The course is based on long text readings with interactive theoretical tasks for each topic. The main focus is on project activities. Projects are the final assignments for each sprint, resembling what QA engineer tasks look like in real work. Of course, this is very nice, as more practice means more chances to be successful professionally.\n\nAdditionally, there is an opportunity to communicate with teachers in any form - voice in Discord or via correspondence (I chose the latter, as I&#39;m not very confident speaking English). The teachers seemed to me to be professionals in their field. I corresponded frequently with Aleksandr Sokolov. Many thanks to him for his involvement and willingness to help. Other teachers helped more with projects (there are recorded videos for each project).\n\nI am working on the seventh project (out of a total of nine), &#39;Introduction to JavaScript,&#39; it&#39;s very challenging for me, but I&#39;m confident I can handle it, as the reviewer helps me. He provides detailed feedback on each project iteration so I can know precisely where my mistake is.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ayoub Jemmal&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1708891200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67269#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve always been interested in QA Engineering as someone with an IT background (Web development). So, recently I decided to switch to QA Still. I didn&#39;t know which Bootcamp to pick, Because I wanted a well-structured curriculum and support so I could gain some time studying especially since I&#39;m working in a full-time job, plus a must-have \&quot;Career Acceleration program\&quot; so I can receive one-on-one coaching, practice interview sessions, and expert guidance to polish my resume. So it will be easier for me to have my first tech job in the USA, as a new immigrant to the states. After a deep research and comparison between different Bootcamps. I found out that TripleTen is the best choice for me. Because they have all the things that I was looking for, and more.. also a lower tuition fee compared to others.Now after I&#39;m almost done with the program, I reached the Final Project. I can clearly state that I don&#39;t regret any penny or minute I invested in this Bootcamp. Some of the things I liked about this program are: - The fact that they keep you always active on the interactive platform with questions and exercises during lessons. - The project at the end of every sprint to practice and be more confident about your skills, the system of project reviewing. - The \&quot;Discord community\&quot; is another cool feature, cause you can access a bunch of extra resources, ask tutors about anything that you had difficulty whether in theory or even the project tasks, and enter the co-learning channel so you can learn with other students, and many more things to do in Discord.- The Career support program, is a main feature for me as I mentioned before. But since I&#39;m still on sprint 9 which is the final sprint before entering career support I can’t speak much on Job hunting. but what I can say is that after submitting every sprint project you&#39;ll have access to extra lessons on job hunting and soft skills that are important in the industry.- Not to forget the flexibility of the program so you can study whenever you want with a convenient rhythm for you.Honestly, everyone in TripleTen is so helpful and professional, including the success manager who&#39;s always making sure that you&#39;re always satisfied and helps you when you need some guidance or information. It has been an incredible journey so far with a great community. Thank you TripleTen&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Devin James&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1708977600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67314#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The QA engineering course for TripleTen has been amazing! The structure of the program really guides you into the right direction. I was previously taking courses on Udemy and also finding other ways to self learn. If you were in my position where you feel like you need that structure, I can promise this program is that. Being able to take your time and really learn the material has been very smooth. There is no rush, there is no classroom setting so you don&#39;t have to worry about falling behind. There are tutors that are constantly available and also having a success manager that regularly contacts you to see how you are doing has been very helpful.  The program is constantly being updated making sure the best material is present. From Sprint 1 to sprint 8 that i&#39;m on, I feel like i&#39;ve finally made progress compared to when i was self learning on my own. I use to feel like i kept constantly getting stuck but the structure of this program has made it a lot easier. This program is also beginner friendly, I believe that if anyone is willing to put in the effort, they will succeed so don&#39;t feel intimidated. What I also really like about the program is the discord community that you are in. Everyone is super helpful and friendly and we all share the same goals. There are other resources and material that are provided to make sure you are succeeding. The comprehensive nature of the program ensures that every aspect of QA engineering is covered thoroughly. Whether it&#39;s mastering testing methodologies or automation skills, there&#39;s  opportunity to dive deep into each topic. As someone who&#39;s currently in the program, I can recommend this to any person no matter the age or experience. I look forward to entering the career readiness program where I will prepare for interviews and hopefully get hired!  TripleTens QA course has been very smooth, rewarding, and challenging.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Re’Laun Tucker&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709150400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67365#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Starting up in tech in this day and age is really important.  My experience at Triple Ten has made me more confident than ever before.  I decided that I wanted to take the route of being a Quality Assurance Engineer.  It started off with me making the right choice for my tuition and what sold me is the money back guarantee.  I networked on LinkedIn to get a feel for the course from other graduates and they were phenomenal and spot on.  I applied and was able to start within the next couple of weeks with my first course.  Each lesson and course is a challenge and definitely requires patience and dedication.  The tutors were absolutely amazing in helping me to understand things I was uncertain of and very patient with someone new joining to deep dive in tech.  I had many questions and the sprints in the lesson help you get a clear understanding of the course.  The projects are built to give you practice and must pass before you move on forward the next course.  They teach you verbiage, foundations even to automation. Once you pass the lessons you get your certificate for what you’ve mastered, and at the end your  certification for passing the course. All in all it’s self paced but should finish within 5-6 months. I will always remember this journey and never forget that I took a leap of faith to change my career course.  Thank you all to triple ten tutors, the career coaches, and especially the students who leaned on one another to assist during my course.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Charmaine Locsin&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709841600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162003333?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67556#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was halfway into my health science degree when the stress started to take its toll on me. Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to learn more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.\nThe website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.\nI chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. \nI love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. \nOne of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!\nI have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tyrus Skipper</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>This 5-month course is a great way to learn new skills with little to no background in quality assurance.

What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65705#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michael Allen</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ve always been interested in tech, but never knew where to start.

However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I&#39;ve been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn&#39;t my tutors &amp; community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I&#39;ve spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks &amp; help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there&#39;s even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir &amp; Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I&#39;m confident once I&#39;m done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I&#39;ve encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF&#39;s and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there&#39;s already been good changes made and I&#39;m on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There&#39;s no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others &quot;5 Stars </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66324#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/65b061d56f7c8a0012c3c1e3/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Carlos Sierra</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen was just a spontaneous decision spurred from an Instagram ad during a time of uncertainty in my career.

I recommend going through either of their programs if you feel, like I did myself, that you could&#39;ve/should&#39;ve gone down a tech-centered career path. It is never too late to make a positive change knowing there&#39;s a support system there to push you to your final goals! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sayuri Yamamoto Shamray</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Last year I decided to change my career, I was looking for something that I could do from home. I worked so many years on sight, I just want the tranquility of my home. I started to look for courses that could give me that freedom, and then I found Tripleten. I had an experience one by one over the ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>phone and I decided that it would be something pleasant to learn. The price was very accessible and It worked for me. You just need to have some time available to study 2 or 3 hours a day, some people are more disciplined, but trust me, I&#39;m not one of them and it still works for me. The support I have from the tutors are awesome, and always when you need help, we have a app called Discord that you can type your issue and somebody will help you anytime, or tutors, or senior students, its wonderful. There are career assistance and LinkedIn assistance also. Don&#39;t think just because is online that you not going to interact with other students, we had a meeting very nice over the zoom and was fun to meet and chat with others. Coming back to the course, they provide high quality material and activities, it worth a lot if you like me is looking to change your career. I would be lying if I tell that it&#39;s easy, because is not, you need to put a lot of effort to make it happen, read the material, and if you need, read it again and again. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><!----><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Svetlana Kubatina</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Like many here, I started learning QA engineering to change my career path.

I chose TripleTen because it&#39;s the only bootcamp with its platform, developed by authors who are active QA engineers, editors, designers, and career consultants. This isn&#39;t just recorded webinars offered by other bootcamps.... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> I especially liked this because I absorb information better in text than audibly, as my English level isn&#39;t high enough to catch everything on the fly.

Moreover, I was attracted by their promise to refund the tuition if I didn&#39;t find a job within six months after the training. This sounded confident from their side, so I realized that the primary goal of this bootcamp was to prepare me for a QA engineer position.

Another advantage over other schools is the flexible payment system for the course. I couldn&#39;t afford to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month like other bootcamps demanded, unlike TripleTen, where I could take a two-year installment plan.

As I expected, TripleTen pleased me with its interactive learning platform. The course is based on long text readings with interactive theoretical tasks for each topic. The main focus is on project activities. Projects are the final assignments for each sprint, resembling what QA engineer tasks look like in real work. Of course, this is very nice, as more practice means more chances to be successful professionally.

Additionally, there is an opportunity to communicate with teachers in any form - voice in Discord or via correspondence (I chose the latter, as I&#39;m not very confident speaking English). The teachers seemed to me to be professionals in their field. I corresponded frequently with Aleksandr Sokolov. Many thanks to him for his involvement and willingness to help. Other teachers helped more with projects (there are recorded videos for each project).

I am working on the seventh project (out of a total of nine), &#39;Introduction to JavaScript,&#39; it&#39;s very challenging for me, but I&#39;m confident I can handle it, as the reviewer helps me. He provides detailed feedback on each project iteration so I can know precisely where my mistake is. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67196#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Ayoub Jemmal</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ve always been interested in QA Engineering as someone with an IT background (Web development). So, recently I decided to switch to QA Still. I didn&#39;t know which Bootcamp to pick, Because I wanted a well-structured curriculum and support so I could gain some time studying especially since I&#39;m work... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ing in a full-time job, plus a must-have &quot;Career Acceleration program&quot; so I can receive one-on-one coaching, practice interview sessions, and expert guidance to polish my resume. So it will be easier for me to have my first tech job in the USA, as a new immigrant to the states. After a deep research and comparison between different Bootcamps. I found out that TripleTen is the best choice for me. Because they have all the things that I was looking for, and more.. also a lower tuition fee compared to others.Now after I&#39;m almost done with the program, I reached the Final Project. I can clearly state that I don&#39;t regret any penny or minute I invested in this Bootcamp. Some of the things I liked about this program are: - The fact that they keep you always active on the interactive platform with questions and exercises during lessons. - The project at the end of every sprint to practice and be more confident about your skills, the system of project reviewing. - The &quot;Discord community&quot; is another cool feature, cause you can access a bunch of extra resources, ask tutors about anything that you had difficulty whether in theory or even the project tasks, and enter the co-learning channel so you can learn with other students, and many more things to do in Discord.- The Career support program, is a main feature for me as I mentioned before. But since I&#39;m still on sprint 9 which is the final sprint before entering career support I can’t speak much on Job hunting. but what I can say is that after submitting every sprint project you&#39;ll have access to extra lessons on job hunting and soft skills that are important in the industry.- Not to forget the flexibility of the program so you can study whenever you want with a convenient rhythm for you.Honestly, everyone in TripleTen is so helpful and professional, including the success manager who&#39;s always making sure that you&#39;re always satisfied and helps you when you need some guidance or information. It has been an incredible journey so far with a great community.

If you were in my position where you feel like you need that structure, I can promise... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> this program is that. Being able to take your time and really learn the material has been very smooth. There is no rush, there is no classroom setting so you don&#39;t have to worry about falling behind. There are tutors that are constantly available and also having a success manager that regularly contacts you to see how you are doing has been very helpful.  The program is constantly being updated making sure the best material is present. From Sprint 1 to sprint 8 that i&#39;m on, I feel like i&#39;ve finally made progress compared to when i was self learning on my own. I use to feel like i kept constantly getting stuck but the structure of this program has made it a lot easier. This program is also beginner friendly, I believe that if anyone is willing to put in the effort, they will succeed so don&#39;t feel intimidated. What I also really like about the program is the discord community that you are in. Everyone is super helpful and friendly and we all share the same goals. There are other resources and material that are provided to make sure you are succeeding. The comprehensive nature of the program ensures that every aspect of QA engineering is covered thoroughly. Whether it&#39;s mastering testing methodologies or automation skills, there&#39;s  opportunity to dive deep into each topic. As someone who&#39;s currently in the program, I can recommend this to any person no matter the age or experience.

I will always remember this journey and never forget that I took a leap of faith to change my career course.  Thank you all to triple ten tutors, the career coaches, and especially the students who leaned on one another to assist during my course. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67365#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162003333?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Charmaine Locsin</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I was halfway into my health science degree when the stress started to take its toll on me. Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to lear... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>n more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.
The website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.
I chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. 
I love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. 
One of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!
I have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67556#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../../index.html#reviews" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../index.html" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../2/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../2/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>2</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>3</span></a><a href="../4/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>4</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../7/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>7</a><a href="../4/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This 5-month course is a great way to learn new skills with little to no background in quality assurance. I did not come into this program as fresh as some people are due to me having an Associates in Computer Programming and currently working in a IT Support role but there were still some fun and challenging sections. What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tyrus Skipper"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-04T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've always been interested in tech, but never knew where to start.

After doing some digging and research to find my next move to make this happen. I was advertised to \"Tripleten\" on a social media feed. However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I've been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn't my tutors & community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I've spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks & help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there's even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir & Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven't completed the program, so I haven't fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I'm confident once I'm done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I've encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF's and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there's already been good changes made and I'm on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There's no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others \"5 Stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jadin D Pauling"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen was just a spontaneous decision spurred from an Instagram ad during a time of uncertainty in my career.

You just need to have some time available to study 2 or 3 hours a day, some people are more disciplined, but trust me, I'm not one of them and it still works for me. The support I have from the tutors are awesome, and always when you need help, we have a app called Discord that you can type your issue and somebody will help you anytime, or tutors, or senior students, its wonderful. There are career assistance and LinkedIn assistance also. Don't think just because is online that you not going to interact with other students, we had a meeting very nice over the zoom and was fun to meet and chat with others. Coming back to the course, they provide high quality material and activities, it worth a lot if you like me is looking to change your career.

This isn't just recorded webinars offered by other bootcamps. I especially liked this because I absorb information better in text than audibly, as my English level isn't high enough to catch everything on the fly.\n\nMoreover, I was attracted by their promise to refund the tuition if I didn't find a job within six months after the training. This sounded confident from their side, so I realized that the primary goal of this bootcamp was to prepare me for a QA engineer position.\n\nAnother advantage over other schools is the flexible payment system for the course. I couldn't afford to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month like other bootcamps demanded, unlike TripleTen, where I could take a two-year installment plan.\n\nAs I expected, TripleTen pleased me with its interactive learning platform. The course is based on long text readings with interactive theoretical tasks for each topic. The main focus is on project activities. Projects are the final assignments for each sprint, resembling what QA engineer tasks look like in real work. Of course, this is very nice, as more practice means more chances to be successful professionally.\n\nAdditionally, there is an opportunity to communicate with teachers in any form - voice in Discord or via correspondence (I chose the latter, as I'm not very confident speaking English). The teachers seemed to me to be professionals in their field. I corresponded frequently with Aleksandr Sokolov. Many thanks to him for his involvement and willingness to help. Other teachers helped more with projects (there are recorded videos for each project).\n\nI am working on the seventh project (out of a total of nine), 'Introduction to JavaScript,' it's very challenging for me, but I'm confident I can handle it, as the reviewer helps me. He provides detailed feedback on each project iteration so I can know precisely where my mistake is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Svetlana Kubatina"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've always been interested in QA Engineering as someone with an IT background (Web development). So, recently I decided to switch to QA Still. I didn't know which Bootcamp to pick, Because I wanted a well-structured curriculum and support so I could gain some time studying especially since I'm working in a full-time job, plus a must-have \"Career Acceleration program\" so I can receive one-on-one coaching, practice interview sessions, and expert guidance to polish my resume. So it will be easier for me to have my first tech job in the USA, as a new immigrant to the states. After a deep research and comparison between different Bootcamps. I found out that TripleTen is the best choice for me. Because they have all the things that I was looking for, and more.. also a lower tuition fee compared to others.Now after I'm almost done with the program, I reached the Final Project. I can clearly state that I don't regret any penny or minute I invested in this Bootcamp. Some of the things I liked about this program are: - The fact that they keep you always active on the interactive platform with questions and exercises during lessons. - The project at the end of every sprint to practice and be more confident about your skills, the system of project reviewing. - The \"Discord community\" is another cool feature, cause you can access a bunch of extra resources, ask tutors about anything that you had difficulty whether in theory or even the project tasks, and enter the co-learning channel so you can learn with other students, and many more things to do in Discord.- The Career support program, is a main feature for me as I mentioned before. But since I'm still on sprint 9 which is the final sprint before entering career support I can’t speak much on Job hunting. but what I can say is that after submitting every sprint project you'll have access to extra lessons on job hunting and soft skills that are important in the industry.- Not to forget the flexibility of the program so you can study whenever you want with a convenient rhythm for you.Honestly, everyone in TripleTen is so helpful and professional, including the success manager who's always making sure that you're always satisfied and helps you when you need some guidance or information. It has been an incredible journey so far with a great community.

The structure of the program really guides you into the right direction. I was previously taking courses on Udemy and also finding other ways to self learn. If you were in my position where you feel like you need that structure, I can promise this program is that. Being able to take your time and really learn the material has been very smooth. There is no rush, there is no classroom setting so you don't have to worry about falling behind. There are tutors that are constantly available and also having a success manager that regularly contacts you to see how you are doing has been very helpful.  The program is constantly being updated making sure the best material is present. From Sprint 1 to sprint 8 that i'm on, I feel like i've finally made progress compared to when i was self learning on my own. I use to feel like i kept constantly getting stuck but the structure of this program has made it a lot easier. This program is also beginner friendly, I believe that if anyone is willing to put in the effort, they will succeed so don't feel intimidated. What I also really like about the program is the discord community that you are in. Everyone is super helpful and friendly and we all share the same goals. There are other resources and material that are provided to make sure you are succeeding. The comprehensive nature of the program ensures that every aspect of QA engineering is covered thoroughly. Whether it's mastering testing methodologies or automation skills, there's  opportunity to dive deep into each topic. As someone who's currently in the program, I can recommend this to any person no matter the age or experience. I look forward to entering the career readiness program where I will prepare for interviews and hopefully get hired!  TripleTens QA course has been very smooth, rewarding, and challenging.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Devin James"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Starting up in tech in this day and age is really important.  My experience at Triple Ten has made me more confident than ever before.  I decided that I wanted to take the route of being a Quality Assurance Engineer.  It started off with me making the right choice for my tuition and what sold me is the money back guarantee.  I networked on LinkedIn to get a feel for the course from other graduates and they were phenomenal and spot on.  I applied and was able to start within the next couple of weeks with my first course.  Each lesson and course is a challenge and definitely requires patience and dedication.  The tutors were absolutely amazing in helping me to understand things I was uncertain of and very patient with someone new joining to deep dive in tech.  I had many questions and the sprints in the lesson help you get a clear understanding of the course.  The projects are built to give you practice and must pass before you move on forward the next course.  They teach you verbiage, foundations even to automation. Once you pass the lessons you get your certificate for what you’ve mastered, and at the end your  certification for passing the course. All in all it’s self paced but should finish within 5-6 months. I will always remember this journey and never forget that I took a leap of faith to change my career course.  Thank you all to triple ten tutors, the career coaches, and especially the students who leaned on one another to assist during my course.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Re’Laun Tucker"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-07T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I was halfway into my health science degree when the stress started to take its toll on me. Things did not go according to plan, so I had to reconsider my career choices. I stumbled across an advertisement for TripleTen on social media and was intrigued by a career quiz. I have always wanted to learn more about coding, but I did not know where to start since I did not have any technical experience. The career quiz eased all the confusion and uncertainty that I was feeling.\nThe website is easy to use and has the essential information I need to understand what I am signing up for. This means even before I contacted someone, I was halfway to making up my mind.\nI chose to take the Quality Assurance Engineer program among the others that TripleTen offers because it was closely aligned with my previous work experience. I figured this course would be a good way to get started in the tech field. \nI love the structure of the program. The materials are split into a series of sprints, and at the end of each, I get to apply what I learned in a hands-on project. It has enhanced the learning experience for me. The program is self-paced requiring about 15 to 20 hours of my time a week. It is designed to be flexible, which is ideal and is exactly what I needed. \nOne of the things I like the most about TripleTen is the support and the community they have built. They have Success Managers who will help with anything that needs to be done throughout the course. Tutors are available to answer any questions on theories and projects. Career coaches who offer frequent webinars and one-on-ones, providing all the tips and guidance to be job-ready by the end of all this. To top it all off, after completing the program, there is an externship opportunity and career support to ensure success in landing a job. It cannot get any better than that!\nI have a few more months to go but I have truly been enjoying this experience so far. I am extremely excited about the new skills that I will be acquiring and I cannot wait to start a new career!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charmaine Locsin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
