I took the quiz on their site, researched a bit about the program, spoke to a few current students and alumni of the program and everyone had good things to say about the program, so I signed up. The initial call was very helpful, and the representative answered all of my questions. So, any reservations I had up to that point went away. TripleTen offers a lot of help to their students with a plethora of tips and tricks for your job search as well. \nI’ve been taking the actual QA courses for around two months now and it is challenging but so far very worth it. From day one the content has been engaging and provides interesting topics. I’m not a fan of coding and there is some involved in this program, but I am getting through it and the tutors are always there to provide help and support. The program is self-paced so I’m hoping to graduate early. There are weekly career talks and tutoring sessions as well. They also have a schedule you can follow along with your class and have an interactive learning session for each topic. The community and success team are very helpful. \nSo far, I would recommend this program.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Julieth Sepulveda&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717012800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69562#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m incredibly happy with my experience at TripleTen. They accepted me without much prior experience and guided me to become a QA engineer. Not only did they teach me all the program basics, but their emotional support was truly remarkable. They walked with me through every step of my journey, ensuring I had all the necessary skills to ace my job interviews. This school is exceptionally organized and genuinely cares about students who are eager to learn. They offer a fantastic platform with a variety of hands-on projects that provide extensive experience. The supportive Discord community, along with dedicated tutors, successful managers, and Dot the AI, made learning a collaborative effort. Additionally, the career coach and other features make TripleTen unique and absolutely worth trying. I highly recommend TripleTen for anyone looking to break into the tech industry with comprehensive support and hands-on learning opportunities.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Julia Dillon&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717704000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69779#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;A few years ago, I wanted to move away from retail and find something that I could enjoy doing while also an increase in income. I had been in retail for many years and wanted to pivot into another field. I have always been enjoyed Information Technology and thought it would be a great time to make the switch. I had completed a bootcamp previously and had issues with finding employment upon completion. I was on the look out for online bootcamps that actually helped you to find a job after completing the program. While scrolling on Instagram I saw an ad for TripleTen. I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don&#39;t start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sebastian Carter&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717963200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69867#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn&#39;t just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate. Before I join TripleTen I searched very heavily in order to find any kind or form of a red flag that would dissuade me from joing the program, but truthfully I had serious difficulties finding any kind of complaint beyond those who simply wanted a job handed to them. TripleTen is an amazing program that get you actually ready for the workforce, and it properly prepares you for what you should expect from a real job; which unfortunately includes a lot of effort and the willingness to grow and learn new things for yourself. If you are at all considering joining TripleTen I would highly recommend it, just remember that they won&#39;t hand you the answers, you still have to put in the effort to be better and every tutor and instructor I&#39;ve personally talked to truly wished to help you achieve as much as you possibly can.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Hiba A.&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718049600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69877#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have been in my current career field for the better half of my adult life and I was fortunate enough to make the right moves to get to a point where now I make good money for it but I know that if anything happens especially in this economy my current position in a new company would not pay as much. I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn&#39;t overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn&#39;t know and challenged me.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;ryley johnson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718654400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/66724bfc35b5f1256fd6cb0d/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated. They are even incorporating AI as it evolves into a helpful learning tool.They have around the clock discord chat for various assistance getting through course studies and networking and career support. They also have tutors who work around the clock that are available for video chat sessions. And what looks like a promising career acceleration program.The only thing is I wish the externships would be guaranteed to the top students because it seems like the most useful item to polish off your portfolio after learning the course.I highly recommend this course, I am learning a lot and as much as I want a job in the field, I am happy that this bootcamp promises money back if I don&#39;t find one within 6 months It&#39;s self paced&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Blake Bailey&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718913600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167792550?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70166#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I stumbled across TripleTen while searching for a new role that would bring fulfillment into my professional career. After researching a little more about the company and what tech role I wanted to pursue. I reached out to meet with an advisor to dismiss any doubts I had about starting a new career. At the conclusion of my meeting I was convinced to start a 2 week trial that helped me understand the pace and information I would begin to learn during the boot camp. What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program.

I’ve been taking the actual QA courses for around two months now and it is challenging but so far very worth it. From day one the content has been engaging and provides interesting topics. I’m not a fan of coding and there is some involved in this program, but I am getting through it and the tutors are always there to provide help and support. The program is self-paced so I’m hoping to graduate early. There are weekly career talks and tutoring sessions as well. They also have a schedule you can follow along with your class and have an interactive learning session for each topic. The community and success team are very helpful. 
So far, I would recommend this program. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69482#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Julieth Sepulveda</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;m incredibly happy with my experience at TripleTen.

I had completed a bootcamp previously and had issues with finding employment upon completion. I was on the look out for online bootcamps that actually helped you to find a job after completing the program. While scrolling on Instagram I saw an ad for TripleTen. I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don&#39;t start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69779#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sebastian Carter</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn&#39;t just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate.

If you are at all considering joining TripleTen I would highly recommend it, just remember that they won&#39;t hand you the answers, you still have to put in the effort to be better and every tutor and instructor I&#39;ve personally talked to truly wished to help you achieve as much as you possibly can. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69867#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Hiba A.</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I have been in my current career field for the better half of my adult life and I was fortunate enough to make the right moves to get to a point where now I make good money for it but I know that if anything happens especially in this economy my current position in a new company would not pay as muc... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>h. I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn&#39;t overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn&#39;t know and challenged me. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69877#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/66724bfc35b5f1256fd6cb0d/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>ryley johnson</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated.

What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program. I would recommend this boot camp to anyone who wants to start their career in tech due to the amount of support that is constantly provided. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70166#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/593f13e60000ff000aa2f1cb/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Billy Samboy</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>This bootcamp is setup perfectly for those that have zero experience in the tech field and actually come from a completely different work experience background like construction or manual labor.

I took the quiz on their site, researched a bit about the program, spoke to a few current students and alumni of the program and everyone had good things to say about the program, so I signed up. The initial call was very helpful, and the representative answered all of my questions. So, any reservations I had up to that point went away. TripleTen offers a lot of help to their students with a plethora of tips and tricks for your job search as well. \nI’ve been taking the actual QA courses for around two months now and it is challenging but so far very worth it. From day one the content has been engaging and provides interesting topics. I’m not a fan of coding and there is some involved in this program, but I am getting through it and the tutors are always there to provide help and support. The program is self-paced so I’m hoping to graduate early. There are weekly career talks and tutoring sessions as well. They also have a schedule you can follow along with your class and have an interactive learning session for each topic. The community and success team are very helpful. \nSo far, I would recommend this program.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leeanne Duval"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I'm incredibly happy with my experience at TripleTen. They accepted me without much prior experience and guided me to become a QA engineer. Not only did they teach me all the program basics, but their emotional support was truly remarkable. They walked with me through every step of my journey, ensuring I had all the necessary skills to ace my job interviews. This school is exceptionally organized and genuinely cares about students who are eager to learn. They offer a fantastic platform with a variety of hands-on projects that provide extensive experience. The supportive Discord community, along with dedicated tutors, successful managers, and Dot the AI, made learning a collaborative effort. Additionally, the career coach and other features make TripleTen unique and absolutely worth trying. I highly recommend TripleTen for anyone looking to break into the tech industry with comprehensive support and hands-on learning opportunities.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julieth Sepulveda"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"A few years ago, I wanted to move away from retail and find something that I could enjoy doing while also an increase in income. I had been in retail for many years and wanted to pivot into another field. I have always been enjoyed Information Technology and thought it would be a great time to make the switch. I had completed a bootcamp previously and had issues with finding employment upon completion. I was on the look out for online bootcamps that actually helped you to find a job after completing the program. While scrolling on Instagram I saw an ad for TripleTen. I looked over their website and experienced their teaching style though their app that they also have. I decided that it was the best offer that I had seen at that time. It almost immediate that someone reached out to me via email. We scheduled a phone meeting and through talking with the admission advisor I decided that the Quality Assurance Engineering program was the best option for me. I started the program on their next cohort in March and have been steadily studying. I have always had all the resources to complete each section. If I have any questions, I have a plethora of people that are there to help me. I also have access to other students inquires and videos in case you are visual learner. After being in the program for four months, I absolutely love this bootcamp. They have an amazing set up for any issues or questions that you have. When you sign up, you are assigned a Success Manager and they will check in on you, answer any questions you have, or get you in touch with people that you need to talk with. There are tutors who are there to help you if you need it, as well as being able to interact with students that are also in the program. I am unemployed at the moment, so I study as though I am back in college and use their suggested timeframes to keep on track. It is also a good option for those who are employed full-time as well. It is self-paced and there is unlimited access to tutors and any resources you might need to get through each section or for your projects. They encourage and facilitate working with others in the program. At a certain time in the program, they help you with your resume, interviews, and other aspects of the job search. They have weekly meetings to talk about certain career The fact that there is career assistance that helps you find a job that you just spent time and energy learning is another plus to this program. My experience is that there are tools given, but TripleTen is actively involved with your success. I also like the idea that if you don't start your career or find a new job within six months, you are guaranteed your money back. If you are looking for a bootcamp that is involved with your growth, your success, and making sure that you are able to follow your dreams- TripleTen is that bootcamp.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julia Dillon"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I found TripleTen at a fairly low point in my life where I was looking for some kind of change, I knew I wanted to get into the tech sphere but was having trouble finding a bootcamp I could trust that wouldn't just leave me out to dry after I finished their certificate. Before I join TripleTen I searched very heavily in order to find any kind or form of a red flag that would dissuade me from joing the program, but truthfully I had serious difficulties finding any kind of complaint beyond those who simply wanted a job handed to them. TripleTen is an amazing program that get you actually ready for the workforce, and it properly prepares you for what you should expect from a real job; which unfortunately includes a lot of effort and the willingness to grow and learn new things for yourself. If you are at all considering joining TripleTen I would highly recommend it, just remember that they won't hand you the answers, you still have to put in the effort to be better and every tutor and instructor I've personally talked to truly wished to help you achieve as much as you possibly can.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sebastian Carter"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have been in my current career field for the better half of my adult life and I was fortunate enough to make the right moves to get to a point where now I make good money for it but I know that if anything happens especially in this economy my current position in a new company would not pay as much. I knew I had to make a change in my life so I can continue to make the same or even more money. This is when I found the TripleTen bootcamp for QA Engineering. While you do not need a tech background for this program I did come from a very strong and similar background to what this course provided. That is why I was able to zoom through the topics and gain a better understanding. I did all this while working my full time job as well. I try to spend at least 1-2 hours a day on only the lessons and I spent time on weekends to do the projects. This structure kept me focused and didn't overwhelm me. Anytime I was confused (and I was a few times) I went to the tutors who always guided me to the right path. Nothing in life is easy and this program is not easy but it was worth every second as it taught me a lot I didn't know and challenged me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hiba A."},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am about halfway through the QA engineering course and I am extremely satisfied with the overall layout of the lessons and the hands on projects.It seems the content is closely monitored and updated.

They also have tutors who work around the clock that are available for video chat sessions. And what looks like a promising career acceleration program.The only thing is I wish the externships would be guaranteed to the top students because it seems like the most useful item to polish off your portfolio after learning the course.I highly recommend this course, I am learning a lot and as much as I want a job in the field, I am happy that this bootcamp promises money back if I don't find one within 6 months It's self paced","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ryley johnson"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-20T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I stumbled across TripleTen while searching for a new role that would bring fulfillment into my professional career. After researching a little more about the company and what tech role I wanted to pursue. I reached out to meet with an advisor to dismiss any doubts I had about starting a new career. At the conclusion of my meeting I was convinced to start a 2 week trial that helped me understand the pace and information I would begin to learn during the boot camp. What sparked my interest in the QA engineer program is my enjoyment for puzzle solving. Even if you are unsure what tech route you want to navigate, TripleTen makes this process easy with a questionnaire that asks you prompts about your interest to help you identify a role that will suit your skill set.I chose TripleTen because of how many resources you have at your disposal from tutors, mentors, other students and alumni that all can be reached on Discord. The program as a whole feels like a community that you can lean on when you come across a problem during a sprint or questions you have on a cover letter/resume. One of my favorite features of this program is the technical and professional skills you obtain during the career portions of the program. I would recommend this boot camp to anyone who wants to start their career in tech due to the amount of support that is constantly provided.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Blake Bailey"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-27T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"This bootcamp is setup perfectly for those that have zero experience in the tech field and actually come from a completely different work experience background like construction or manual labor.
