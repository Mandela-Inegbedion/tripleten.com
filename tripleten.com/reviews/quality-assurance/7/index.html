Engaging with the QA Engineering team, I was spellbound by their precise knack for detecting glitches and ensuring seamless user experience. The strategic and meticulous nature of their work lured me in. Though marketing had its charm, ensuring a software&#39;s highest quality was a siren&#39;s call I couldn&#39;t resist. Thus began my dive into the world of QA Engineering.\n\nTripleTen Bootcamp became my North Star as I transitioned. As someone grounded in marketing with no inkling of QA, the bootcamp I chose was pivotal. TripleTen came highly recommended, especially for its practical, beginner-focused approach.\n\nMy routine became an exciting blend of understanding QA principles in the mornings, and immersing in hands-on testing scenarios in the evenings. The TripleTen platform brilliantly provided an almost real-world QA environment. Tasked with challenges from bug detection to drafting test scenarios, every project felt like a direct peek into what lay ahead in the industry. And, the camaraderie formed with my tutors and fellow students was pure gold. Our Discord channel, became our digital hub for sharing insights, seeking solutions, and sprinkling in a bit of humor.\n\nIn essence, TripleTen Bootcamp transformed my career aspirations into tangible skills. It’s not just an academic exercise, but a real-time preparatory course for the world of QA Engineering. If you wish to guarantee software perfection and are keen on QA Engineering, TripleTen is the ideal springboard.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ben Whitty&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of the QA Engineer Program by TripleTen!

I&#39;ve always enjoyed coming up with solutions to problems, as well as being at the cutting edge of new technology. I found Quality Assurance Engineering to not only be a growth market, but a field that fit my passions. I chose to complete the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp because it both fit my schedule and afforded me a wealth of knowledge about QA Engineering, which I was able to put to good use in a QA Analyst position. Throughout the TripleTen program, I was working in a job with rotating shifts, so I had to diligently schedule when I could study and complete the TripleTen projects. This required me to prioritize at least 20 hours a week for the program. I also took advantage of the open hour study halls where I could ask instructors and peers questions to better understand the theories presented. In addition to the core curriculum, I found the extra modules about specific topics to be especially helpful in filling in any gaps left by the theory portion of the work. I would say that&#39;s the biggest con of the program, that I had to do a lot of independent and additional learning to be able to complete the projects. However, if you&#39;re willing to really invest in yourself and your knowledge, this is a great program; I would say the biggest pro to TripleTen is how flexible it can be to work around any schedule. After graduating from the program, I found that the continued career guidance was helpful in keeping me accountable. It would have been easy to become discouraged by a few job rejections, but having the career coach helped me stay persistent in my search, which ultimately led to me finding my current position. Overall, I&#39;d say the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp was worth it; it was definitely a lot of work and effort, but it paid off in the end.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Eileen Battad</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I came across TripleTen in a YouTube ad one day and saw that they had several tech programs to offer.

TripleTen Bootcamp became my North Star as I transitioned. As someone grounded in marketing with no inkling of QA, the bootcamp I chose was pivotal. TripleTen came highly recommended, especially for its practical, beginner-focused approach.

My routine became an exciting blend of understanding QA principles in the mornings, and immersing in hands-on testing scenarios in the evenings. The TripleTen platform brilliantly provided an almost real-world QA environment. Tasked with challenges from bug detection to drafting test scenarios, every project felt like a direct peek into what lay ahead in the industry.

I&#39;ve always enjoyed coming up with solutions to problems, as well as being at the cutting edge of new technology. I found Quality Assurance Engineering to not only be a growth market, but a field that fit... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> my passions. I chose to complete the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp because it both fit my schedule and afforded me a wealth of knowledge about QA Engineering, which I was able to put to good use in a QA Analyst position. Throughout the TripleTen program, I was working in a job with rotating shifts, so I had to diligently schedule when I could study and complete the TripleTen projects. This required me to prioritize at least 20 hours a week for the program. I also took advantage of the open hour study halls where I could ask instructors and peers questions to better understand the theories presented. In addition to the core curriculum, I found the extra modules about specific topics to be especially helpful in filling in any gaps left by the theory portion of the work. I would say that&#39;s the biggest con of the program, that I had to do a lot of independent and additional learning to be able to complete the projects. However, if you&#39;re willing to really invest in yourself and your knowledge, this is a great program; I would say the biggest pro to TripleTen is how flexible it can be to work around any schedule. After graduating from the program, I found that the continued career guidance was helpful in keeping me accountable. It would have been easy to become discouraged by a few job rejections, but having the career coach helped me stay persistent in my search, which ultimately led to me finding my current position. Overall, I&#39;d say the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp was worth it; it was definitely a lot of work and effort, but it paid off in the end. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../../index.html#reviews" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../index.html" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../6/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../6/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>6</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>7</span></a><!----><!----><!----><!----></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-16T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I came across TripleTen in a YouTube ad one day and saw that they had several tech programs to offer.

I've always enjoyed coming up with solutions to problems, as well as being at the cutting edge of new technology. I found Quality Assurance Engineering to not only be a growth market, but a field that fit my passions. I chose to complete the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp because it both fit my schedule and afforded me a wealth of knowledge about QA Engineering, which I was able to put to good use in a QA Analyst position. Throughout the TripleTen program, I was working in a job with rotating shifts, so I had to diligently schedule when I could study and complete the TripleTen projects. This required me to prioritize at least 20 hours a week for the program. I also took advantage of the open hour study halls where I could ask instructors and peers questions to better understand the theories presented. In addition to the core curriculum, I found the extra modules about specific topics to be especially helpful in filling in any gaps left by the theory portion of the work. I would say that's the biggest con of the program, that I had to do a lot of independent and additional learning to be able to complete the projects. However, if you're willing to really invest in yourself and your knowledge, this is a great program; I would say the biggest pro to TripleTen is how flexible it can be to work around any schedule. After graduating from the program, I found that the continued career guidance was helpful in keeping me accountable. It would have been easy to become discouraged by a few job rejections, but having the career coach helped me stay persistent in my search, which ultimately led to me finding my current position. Overall, I'd say the TripleTen Quality Assurance Engineering Bootcamp was worth it; it was definitely a lot of work and effort, but it paid off in the end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Zachary Sanders"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
