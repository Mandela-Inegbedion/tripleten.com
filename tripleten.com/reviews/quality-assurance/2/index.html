I chose to learn QA Engineering because of my passion for ensuring the quality and reliability of software in our tech-driven world. I&#39;ve always had a passion for technology and a keen interest in making sure digital products meet high-quality standards. This drove me to start learning QA Engineering. I picked TripleTen, which used to be Practicum because they&#39;re known for excellent tech education. What really got my attention were their practical projects that feel like real work and their easy-to-use platform. Those projects taught me a lot, and the platform made learning a breeze. As I delved deeper into the tech realm, I realized the crucial role that quality assurance plays in delivering reliable software. Software applications are becoming increasingly complex, and the margin for error is minimal. A single glitch or bug can have significant consequences, ranging from inconveniences for users to critical security breaches. It became evident that the pursuit of excellence in software quality was essential. This realization led me to the path of QA Engineering. I wanted to be part of the solution, to contribute to the development of technology that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. QA Engineering, with its focus on identifying and rectifying software defects, resonated with me. It offered the opportunity to apply my passion for technology in a meaningful way, ensuring that software products are of the highest quality possible. TripleTen has made my QA journey both demanding and fun, and I&#39;m eager to see where it leads me. I aim to start working as a Manual mobile QA soon with the knowledge I’ve acquired at TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Eder Fernandez&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1695672000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63433#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After months of searching, I&#39;m thrilled that I ended up choosing TripleTen&#39;s QA program. The program provides a comprehensive education in QA (manual &amp; automation), as well as other essential skills like SQL and working with CLI&#39;s. The Discord community is a fantastic source of support, always ready to assist. The personalized one-on-one sessions with seasoned QA professionals were a standout feature. As a career changer going into the tech job market for the first time, the guidance of a dedicated career coach has proven invaluable. They&#39;ve helped polish my LinkedIn profile, cover letter, and resume, ensuring they truly shine.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Noe Campos&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1700596800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=64666#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Choosing a Bootcamp was not easy, I&#39;m not going to lie, but I was comparing several bootcamps to find out which one was best for me. I decided on the QA Engineer program because it seemed interesting and a way to get started in the world of technology. The program provides an essential education.Triplete convinced me not only because of how flexible they are with schedules, but also because of how fast they are. They are attentive, they clarified my doubts, the payments are very flexible, and they also have a high rate of graduates who have found work after finishing. the program and if they don&#39;t, you will get your money back guaranteed. Another thing that caught my attention is that they have externships for work experience.To study I try to do it after work, at least 3 hours a day or if I have free days I dedicate a little more time, I can say about 15 hours a week.My TripleTen experience has been amazing! I love the interactive platform and the projects are my favorites, why? I like the idea of having to interact and put into practice what I have studied, when my project is correct it makes me want to move forward and not give up.  The learning team and community are very supportive and helpful. I learned a lot from them.  But overall, I&#39;m really enjoying it!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Arpi Keshishyan&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1700769600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/656114348555180013873a02/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, I am Manual QA engineer with 3 years of experience. I worked in 2 companies before moving to USA. But I feel that I need to update my skills and get new skills in coding. After long research I find TripleTen. It’s really good course to start your career in IT filed. The theory part is really big and interesting, even being manual QA there was a lot of new things that I learned. The coding part was really challenge for me, but I was working with professional team. The tutors and manager helped me a lot to go though all of that. And the important thing for me that you have chance to work in real project. There is really good community there and you can meet many new and interesting people. And if you will have time to communicate with them you will learn a lot of important and useful things from them.Thanks TripleTen team for everything it was really enjoyable to learn from you and work with you.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Larissa Smith&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702152000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92655643?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Why did I choose TripleTen for my coding journey? I did some research and wanted a platform that stood out in the coding education crowd. As a graduate of another coding BootCamp, I can personally appreciateTripleTen&#39;s commitment to their curriculum and students, which exceeded my previous experience. TripleTen&#39;s program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum and career program was all about making sure I&#39;m set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn&#39;t just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it&#39;s a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren&#39;t just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry&#39;s demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It&#39;s a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.\n\nNow, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I&#39;ve graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen&#39;s program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn&#39;t have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn&#39;t take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.\n\nTripleTen&#39;s features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It&#39;s like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn&#39;t just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn&#39;t some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn&#39;t your typical classroom scene. Don&#39;t expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It&#39;s more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that&#39;s the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn&#39;t need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that&#39;s a plus. And it&#39;s all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  \n\nTripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn&#39;t blame TripleTen for that; I think it&#39;s just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don&#39;t have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!\n\nThankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.\n\nIf you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that&#39;s more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn&#39;t demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That&#39;s when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn&#39;t just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn&#39;t just about coding; it&#39;s about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you&#39;re not just learning; you&#39;re gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. \nAs of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I&#39;ve learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn&#39;t even need to take a loan, so I&#39;m graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you&#39;re on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you&#39;re in good hands. Good luck!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kyle Kolodziej&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702497600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I chose the QA Engineering track as a way to bolster my current experience within QA work, and to get more relevant knowledge and experience with coding/software QA work. After reviewing a few different options, that were extremely code-heavy and costly, I found tripleten. The initial conversation I had with the guidance team was very promising and reassuring, so I took the leap and started the QA track. After finishing the course the assistance through the career acceleration program has been extremely helpful. Compared to the assistance you receive from college post-graduation, TripleTen works with you 1-on-1 to make sure your resume best reflects your skills and stands out from the rest.

The catalyst for my career change was the desire to break free from the monotonous 9 to 5 routine, lack of growth opportunities, and a schedule that kept me away from quality time with friends and family. The appeal of a tech career lay in the promise of a balanced work-life equation and the opportunity to continually acquire new skills while refining existing ones for career advancement.Embarking on this journey while working full-time and undergoing a major move from California to Arizona posed significant challenges. However, Triple Ten demonstrated exceptional understanding by allowing me the flexibility to temporarily step away from my studies to focus on the relocation. This gesture highlighted the program&#39;s commitment to supporting students through real-life challenges, setting a positive tone for the entire experience.To be candid, the course has been anything but easy. It has presented me with formidable challenges, pushing me out of my comfort zone and demanding a substantial commitment of time and effort. Yet, what has made this journey worthwhile and ultimately successful has been the unwavering support system provided by Triple Ten.The tutors associated with the program have been instrumental in my learning process. Their expertise, accessibility, and patience have turned what seemed insurmountable into manageable challenges. The collaborative spirit among fellow students has fostered a sense of community and shared learning, where we celebrate successes and navigate difficulties together. The community managers, too, have played a pivotal role, ensuring that the support network extends beyond academic concerns to encompass the holistic well-being of each student.Triple Ten has not just been an educational platform; it&#39;s been a partner in my personal and professional growth. The emphasis on community, combined with the dedication to accommodating life&#39;s unexpected turns, sets this bootcamp apart. While the road has been tough, the sense of achievement and the arsenal of skills acquired make every hurdle worthwhile.In conclusion, if you are ready to embrace challenges, eager to learn, and seeking a supportive community to guide you through the complexities of the tech world, Triple Ten QA Engineering Bootcamp is the transformative journey you&#39;ve been looking for.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Esme Goral&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702929600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65536#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I joined Triple Ten because I knew I wanted a career change, and I was not sure how to do so, but thanks to Triple Tens curriculum I knew I could make the change! They break things down so simple that you could do it in your sleep and since I am new to the tech world, I knew I needed a program that could do so.  The program is self-pace all online and if you ever find yourself in need of assistance to help further understand the chapter, they have tutors waiting to help you via chat and they also have one on one sessions, which has helped me tremendously in some chapters! I have learned so much since starting in September that I never knew I could do something like this before. I also like this bootcamp rather than other ones that I was searching due to its 6 months after graduate money back guarantee, if you don&#39;t find yourself a job within that time range, which was huge major decision for me because IT is new for me, so I knew I needed a safety blanket and Triple Ten helped with that decision. They also have career coach one on one&#39;s sessions and career lessons to help you with your LinkedIn so you can get a head start on the job hunt before graduating! Overall, I am glad I made the switch for myself this year, it has taught me to so much that I now think completely different which means I am growing as individual.

This drove me to start learning QA Engineering. I picked TripleTen, which used to be Practicum because they&#39;re known for excellent tech education. What really got my attention were their practical projects that feel like real work and their easy-to-use platform. Those projects taught me a lot, and the platform made learning a breeze. As I delved deeper into the tech realm, I realized the crucial role that quality assurance plays in delivering reliable software. Software applications are becoming increasingly complex, and the margin for error is minimal. A single glitch or bug can have significant consequences, ranging from inconveniences for users to critical security breaches. It became evident that the pursuit of excellence in software quality was essential. This realization led me to the path of QA Engineering. I wanted to be part of the solution, to contribute to the development of technology that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. QA Engineering, with its focus on identifying and rectifying software defects, resonated with me. It offered the opportunity to apply my passion for technology in a meaningful way, ensuring that software products are of the highest quality possible. TripleTen has made my QA journey both demanding and fun, and I&#39;m eager to see where it leads me. I aim to start working as a Manual mobile QA soon with the knowledge I’ve acquired at TripleTen. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=62827#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Eder Fernandez</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>After months of searching, I&#39;m thrilled that I ended up choosing TripleTen&#39;s QA program.

I did some research and wanted a platform that stood out in the coding education crowd. As a graduate of another coding BootCamp, I can personally appreciateTripleTen&#39;s commitment to their curriculum and students, which exceeded my previous experienc... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>e. TripleTen&#39;s program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum and career program was all about making sure I&#39;m set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn&#39;t just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it&#39;s a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren&#39;t just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry&#39;s demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It&#39;s a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.

Now, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I&#39;ve graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen&#39;s program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn&#39;t have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn&#39;t take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.

TripleTen&#39;s features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It&#39;s like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn&#39;t just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn&#39;t some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn&#39;t your typical classroom scene. Don&#39;t expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It&#39;s more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that&#39;s the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn&#39;t need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that&#39;s a plus. And it&#39;s all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  

TripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn&#39;t blame TripleTen for that; I think it&#39;s just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don&#39;t have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!

Thankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.

If you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that&#39;s more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn&#39;t demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That&#39;s when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn&#39;t just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn&#39;t just about coding; it&#39;s about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you&#39;re not just learning; you&#39;re gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. 
As of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I&#39;ve learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn&#39;t even need to take a loan, so I&#39;m graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you&#39;re on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you&#39;re in good hands. Good luck! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><!----><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kyle Kolodziej</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose the QA Engineering track as a way to bolster my current experience within QA work, and to get more relevant knowledge and experience with coding/software QA work.

As I delved deeper into the tech realm, I realized the crucial role that quality assurance plays in delivering reliable software. Software applications are becoming increasingly complex, and the margin for error is minimal. A single glitch or bug can have significant consequences, ranging from inconveniences for users to critical security breaches. It became evident that the pursuit of excellence in software quality was essential. This realization led me to the path of QA Engineering. I wanted to be part of the solution, to contribute to the development of technology that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. QA Engineering, with its focus on identifying and rectifying software defects, resonated with me. It offered the opportunity to apply my passion for technology in a meaningful way, ensuring that software products are of the highest quality possible. TripleTen has made my QA journey both demanding and fun, and I'm eager to see where it leads me. I aim to start working as a Manual mobile QA soon with the knowledge I’ve acquired at TripleTen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michelle Beaubrun"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-25T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After months of searching, I'm thrilled that I ended up choosing TripleTen's QA program.

I decided on the QA Engineer program because it seemed interesting and a way to get started in the world of technology. The program provides an essential education.Triplete convinced me not only because of how flexible they are with schedules, but also because of how fast they are. They are attentive, they clarified my doubts, the payments are very flexible, and they also have a high rate of graduates who have found work after finishing. the program and if they don't, you will get your money back guaranteed. Another thing that caught my attention is that they have externships for work experience.To study I try to do it after work, at least 3 hours a day or if I have free days I dedicate a little more time, I can say about 15 hours a week.My TripleTen experience has been amazing! I love the interactive platform and the projects are my favorites, why? I like the idea of having to interact and put into practice what I have studied, when my project is correct it makes me want to move forward and not give up.  The learning team and community are very supportive and helpful.

I did some research and wanted a platform that stood out in the coding education crowd. As a graduate of another coding BootCamp, I can personally appreciateTripleTen's commitment to their curriculum and students, which exceeded my previous experience. TripleTen's program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen's curriculum and career program was all about making sure I'm set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn't just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it's a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren't just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry's demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It's a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.\n\nNow, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I've graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen's program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn't have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn't take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.\n\nTripleTen's features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It's like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn't just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn't some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn't your typical classroom scene. Don't expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It's more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that's the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn't need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that's a plus. And it's all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  \n\nTripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I'm sure it's like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn't blame TripleTen for that; I think it's just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don't have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!\n\nThankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.\n\nIf you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that's more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn't demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That's when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn't just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn't just about coding; it's about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you're not just learning; you're gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. \nAs of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I've learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn't even need to take a loan, so I'm graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you're on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you're in good hands. Good luck!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Larissa Smith"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-13T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I chose the QA Engineering track as a way to bolster my current experience within QA work, and to get more relevant knowledge and experience with coding/software QA work.

They break things down so simple that you could do it in your sleep and since I am new to the tech world, I knew I needed a program that could do so.  The program is self-pace all online and if you ever find yourself in need of assistance to help further understand the chapter, they have tutors waiting to help you via chat and they also have one on one sessions, which has helped me tremendously in some chapters! I have learned so much since starting in September that I never knew I could do something like this before. I also like this bootcamp rather than other ones that I was searching due to its 6 months after graduate money back guarantee, if you don't find yourself a job within that time range, which was huge major decision for me because IT is new for me, so I knew I needed a safety blanket and Triple Ten helped with that decision.
