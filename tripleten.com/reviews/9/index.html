I compared several bootcamps prior to selecting TripleTen and it was the best fit for me due to the flexible study schedule, breadth of the curriculum, continuous support from the community managers &amp; tutors, and affordability.I liked TripleTen&#39;s interactive platform with real-world tasks in each sprint, which makes it easy to see the value in the material, and how it can be applied to solving data science problems. The sprint projects are also real-world tasks, optimized to focus on material from the sprint and put the knowledge to practice.  TripleTen&#39;s comprehensive data science program has helped me learn Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, Git, and machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised for classification and regression tasks. Even though support is readily available from tutors during office hours and quick-to-respond community managers, I encourage you to challenge yourself and not ask for help until you&#39;ve really tried as this will make the solution more rewarding and memorable.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Cody O&#39;Brien&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687982400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60671#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m still a student at TripleTen, and I&#39;ve gone through 9 of the 16 total sprints so far. From the very first one, the information was presented in a clear and effective manner. The theory is comprehensive without being overwhelming, and the exercises are great reinforcement of each of the theory segments. The projects at the end of each sprint are direct applications of the information presented in the chapter, with just enough challenge to push your skills and solidify your learning. There&#39;s just enough guidance to let you figure out things own your own, or get help from tutors. Each sprint builds on past material very well, advancing your knowledge as the program goes along. The community support and engagement is great as well. Community managers and tutors are super responsive and helpful; the scheduled office hours for students to have a planned time to ask for help and questions are very useful as well. The tutors are very knowledgeable; they&#39;re always willing to help, and explain ideas beyond the scope of projects or sprints.TripleTen has been a great experience so far, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get into software engineering.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kory Russell&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687982400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am a current student of Triple Ten (Formerly Practicum) and I have to say I knew going into this bootcamp after being mesmerized by the first free sprint that I loved doing this. I underestimated the intense core of what is involved, and while I still am loving this bootcamp, rest assured you will work hard to achieve the results you are looking for. I love my Community Manager- Dina, she is awesome and works with you so well, and there are some amazing tutors almost always available. Sometimes I have a hard time following the lessons and studying in Theory, but I do eventually get it, and now entering Sprint 2. I cannot wait to see what I will continue to learn. SUPER INTENSE = SUPER SATISFACTION here, and its so far worth every penny I have paid for my tuition. I have no doubts if you want the best engineering learning, this is the bootcamp to choose. I ALSO have learned so much about myself like how I am teaching myself to pay more attention to syntax and grammar, trust me it matters! I have learned how satisfying it is to finish something even if there are a few things I missed, I can go back and in real time learn how to not repeat them. It takes a while to get some of the concepts, but I like the way Practicum has laid the Sprints out, even early into the bootcamp. Thanks Triple Ten!

I was looking for a bootcamp that could fulfill a few things. I wanted it to be a strong bootcamp, with flexible hours. I work a full time job, and many other commitments, so finding something that was flexible was one of my top priorities. Many other bootcamps require you to join a live coding class, which I think is extremely helpful, but hard to commit to when you have other responsibilities. TripleTen allows me to work on my own schedule. I also find the coursework to be extremely strong, and progresses from easily to very difficult, which allows you to become accustomed to the platform, coding and learning. The community of learners is super strong helpful and encouraging. I have started close relationships with other students which has allowed me to 1) grow my network, 2) make friends in the field, and 3) get support from other students. We have created a community where we come together to support each other. The tutors are super helpful and are often available at many different hours of the day.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Levy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1688241600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I have completed the first third of the Data Science Bootcamp as of today. I decided to go with TripleTen (Originally Practicum when I was researching programs) after several weeks of investigating various online Data Science Bootcamps. One of the biggest selling points for me was the opportunity to do work for a real company while in the program. I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module&#39;s discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends. Overall I feel like it is a great program and I highly recommend it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brandi Booth&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1688673600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130495796?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60919#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to start learning Data Science because solving problems interest me.  I&#39;d like to have a work from home position where what I do uniquely helps the company.  I have an analytical personality and I am good at analyzing details.The training platform is helpful because there is theoretical learning.  Like it explains the new topics and then backs it up with code for you to do the work of what you just learned.  The projects give you a chance to work on real world business topics that you might actually do in the field.  The tutors are helpful when you can get one.  I don&#39;t like that its challenging to casually get explaination for things you may not understand.   Code reviewers are tough, sometimes they give a hard time.  Community managers are as helpful as can be.  The other classmates are golden, and a great support system.\nI am learning new skills and concepts I never even thought of, and I think I will be able actually do the skills needed. I just am really hopeful I will be able to get a great job in this field.  I chose TripleTen because of the gaurnatee  for the job.  The program is really challenging and it takes a lot of dedication.  Just have to trust that the team here is training us well and we will acquire good paying work in our field.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kiffany Francis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1688673600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96302743?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60912#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I chose TripleTen (formerly Practicum) because of the opportunities for a flexible schedule, code review, the money-back job guarantee, and live tutors and community. I&#39;ve been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React at the moment. I&#39;m hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get \&quot;stuck\&quot; or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can&#39;t make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They&#39;re such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can&#39;t comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an \&quot;apiary\&quot; or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven&#39;t known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn&#39;t been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don&#39;t really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it&#39;s necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.\nOverall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I&#39;m hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Elmira Sapanova&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1689105600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;About two years ago I decided to shift my career into the tech industry. At that time, I was working in a job I didn&#39;t like, and it presented the perfect opportunity for me to pursue further education. After researching various boot camps online, I came across an advertisement for TripleTen (formerly Practicum), and I decided to enroll in their Data Analytics course. I&#39;m not exactly sure why, but something about this boot camp felt right—the comprehensive information provided, the well-structured curriculum, also the encouraging call I received from their representative. I must admit that the course was very challenging and intense for me, but it was definitely worth the effort to complete it. I have a tendency to take things very seriously, and there were times when I made mistakes or failed to seek help in advance, which may have taken longer to complete the course. Nevertheless, I persevered, learned a lot, and gained valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. The course also provided real-world projects that enhanced my resume. Through this experience, I learned that it&#39;s okay when things don&#39;t go as planned, and it&#39;s acceptable to make mistakes and move forward when necessary. I am grateful for the incredible support team, code reviewers, tutors, and the welcoming community. I want to express my appreciation to my exceptional community manager, Marina, who has been extremely supportive and always there for me. Altogether, my experience with TripleTen has been excellent so far, and I have no doubts that if you are seeking the best engineering education, this is the boot camp to choose from.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jose Valenzuela&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1689624000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I would like to start this review of why I chose TripleTen as the bootcamp to learn how to become a Data Analyst. Before joining TripleTen, I had tried to study the different subjects that are provided within the course, like learning Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL and Python. But learning these subjects on my own proved to be a very difficult task and could not find the time or the structure to study these subjects correctly and to understand them was an even harder task. As I started to review and investigate different bootcamps, I came across TripleTen. I was immediately convinced as it had very positive reviews from previous students, the price point was very reasonable (with different payment options) and the course completion of 6 months was very appealing. Before beginning, you have a phone conference with a TripleTen representative that explains the course in detail and it helped me to make the decision to enter this bootcamp. Upon entering, you are given a start date and an orientation, that answers any doubts that you might have about the bootcamp. The structure of the course is very adaptable to anyone. I am currently working a full-time job, from 8am - 5pm, and always found the time to study either during my lunch breaks or after work. I also structured study time during the weekends so that I would not fall behind. In total, I would say that I would study around 15-20 hours per week. The bootcamp is structured in a very reasonable and workable way. You first are given material to read and review about each subject, like Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, etc. During theoretical learning, you are also given review task which cement the learning material further. After every sprint (how the course is divided, about 2-3 weeks of learning), you are to complete a project about what you learned. The projects to me were my favorite thing about the bootcamp, as they require you to apply all of your knowledge that you learned during the sprint. The projects are also the most fundamental part of the bootcamp, in my opinion, because it is the evidence that you learned the material and is what you are able to present to future employers. Tips and advice for anyone thinking of joining this bootcamp is to not be discouraged if any of the material appears to be harder than expected. If it were easy, anybody would do it. Also, the support from tutors and project manager is always available and they are always willing to help and guide you through any difficulties. Another thing to consider it to always make the time, there will be days when you will feel overwhelmed, but trust me when I say that it is possible and by putting your mind to it, it is always possible. Also, the times are very flexible and even working full-time, I never fell behind in any sprint. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my time with TripleTen and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about getting into the tech industry.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brandi Booth&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1690142400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen has a good online community with study buddies 5 days a week, and teambuilding if you take advantage of opportunities with cohort members. The community is one of the best parts. Tutors seem less available once you&#39;re in the program for months. They also want specific questions verses,\&quot; I don&#39;t understand, please help\&quot; approach. This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47305630?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Ahmad Hijazi</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started this data science journey to transition into an exciting new field from engineering.

The projects at the end of each sprint are direct applications of the information presented in the chapter, with just enough challenge to push your skills and solidify your learning. There&#39;s just enough guidance to let you figure out things own your own, or get help from tutors. Each sprint builds on past material very well, advancing your knowledge as the program goes along. The community support and engagement is great as well. Community managers and tutors are super responsive and helpful; the scheduled office hours for students to have a planned time to ask for help and questions are very useful as well. The tutors are very knowledgeable; they&#39;re always willing to help, and explain ideas beyond the scope of projects or sprints.TripleTen has been a great experience so far, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get into software engineering. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60671#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kory Russell</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am a current student of Triple Ten (Formerly Practicum) and I have to say I knew going into this bootcamp after being mesmerized by the first free sprint that I loved doing this.

I have learned how satisfying it is to finish something even if there are a few things I missed, I can go back and in real time learn how to not repeat them.

Many other bootcamps require you to join a live coding class, which I think is extremely helpful, but hard to commit to when you have other responsibilities. TripleTen allows me to work on my own schedule. I also find the coursework to be extremely strong, and progresses from easily to very difficult, which allows you to become accustomed to the platform, coding and learning. The community of learners is super strong helpful and encouraging. I have started close relationships with other students which has allowed me to 1) grow my network, 2) make friends in the field, and 3) get support from other students. We have created a community where we come together to support each other.

One of the biggest selling points for me was the opportunity to... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> do work for a real company while in the program. I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module&#39;s discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends. Overall I feel like it is a great program and I highly recommend it. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130495796?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Brandi Booth</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I decided to start learning Data Science because solving problems interest me.  I&#39;d like to have a work from home position where what I do uniquely helps the company.  I have an analytical personality and I am good at analyzing details.The training platform is helpful because there is theoretical le... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>arning.  Like it explains the new topics and then backs it up with code for you to do the work of what you just learned.  The projects give you a chance to work on real world business topics that you might actually do in the field.  The tutors are helpful when you can get one.  I don&#39;t like that its challenging to casually get explaination for things you may not understand.   Code reviewers are tough, sometimes they give a hard time.  Community managers are as helpful as can be.  The other classmates are golden, and a great support system.
I am learning new skills and concepts I never even thought of, and I think I will be able actually do the skills needed.

I&#39;ve been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>at the moment. I&#39;m hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get &quot;stuck&quot; or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can&#39;t make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They&#39;re such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can&#39;t comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an &quot;apiary&quot; or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven&#39;t known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn&#39;t been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don&#39;t really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it&#39;s necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.
Overall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I&#39;m hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60912#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Elmira Sapanova</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>About two years ago I decided to shift my career into the tech industry. At that time, I was working in a job I didn&#39;t like, and it presented the perfect opportunity for me to pursue further education. After researching various boot camps online, I came across an advertisement for TripleTen (formerl... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>y Practicum), and I decided to enroll in their Data Analytics course. I&#39;m not exactly sure why, but something about this boot camp felt right—the comprehensive information provided, the well-structured curriculum, also the encouraging call I received from their representative. I must admit that the course was very challenging and intense for me, but it was definitely worth the effort to complete it. I have a tendency to take things very seriously, and there were times when I made mistakes or failed to seek help in advance, which may have taken longer to complete the course. Nevertheless, I persevered, learned a lot, and gained valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. The course also provided real-world projects that enhanced my resume. Through this experience, I learned that it&#39;s okay when things don&#39;t go as planned, and it&#39;s acceptable to make mistakes and move forward when necessary. I am grateful for the incredible support team, code reviewers, tutors, and the welcoming community. I want to express my appreciation to my exceptional community manager, Marina, who has been extremely supportive and always there for me. Altogether, my experience with TripleTen has been excellent so far, and I have no doubts that if you are seeking the best engineering education, this is the boot camp to choose from. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jose Valenzuela</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I would like to start this review of why I chose TripleTen as the bootcamp to learn how to become a Data Analyst. Before joining TripleTen, I had tried to study the different subjects that are provided within the course, like learning Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL and Python. But learning these subjects o... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>n my own proved to be a very difficult task and could not find the time or the structure to study these subjects correctly and to understand them was an even harder task. As I started to review and investigate different bootcamps, I came across TripleTen. I was immediately convinced as it had very positive reviews from previous students, the price point was very reasonable (with different payment options) and the course completion of 6 months was very appealing. Before beginning, you have a phone conference with a TripleTen representative that explains the course in detail and it helped me to make the decision to enter this bootcamp. Upon entering, you are given a start date and an orientation, that answers any doubts that you might have about the bootcamp. The structure of the course is very adaptable to anyone. I am currently working a full-time job, from 8am - 5pm, and always found the time to study either during my lunch breaks or after work. I also structured study time during the weekends so that I would not fall behind. In total, I would say that I would study around 15-20 hours per week. The bootcamp is structured in a very reasonable and workable way. You first are given material to read and review about each subject, like Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, etc. During theoretical learning, you are also given review task which cement the learning material further. After every sprint (how the course is divided, about 2-3 weeks of learning), you are to complete a project about what you learned. The projects to me were my favorite thing about the bootcamp, as they require you to apply all of your knowledge that you learned during the sprint. The projects are also the most fundamental part of the bootcamp, in my opinion, because it is the evidence that you learned the material and is what you are able to present to future employers. Tips and advice for anyone thinking of joining this bootcamp is to not be discouraged if any of the material appears to be harder than expected. If it were easy, anybody would do it. Also, the support from tutors and project manager is always available and they are always willing to help and guide you through any difficulties. Another thing to consider it to always make the time, there will be days when you will feel overwhelmed, but trust me when I say that it is possible and by putting your mind to it, it is always possible. Also, the times are very flexible and even working full-time, I never fell behind in any sprint. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my time with TripleTen and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about getting into the tech industry. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Brandi Booth</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen has a good online community with study buddies 5 days a week, and teambuilding if you take advantage of opportunities with cohort members.

This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../8/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../8/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>8</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>9</span></a><a href="../10/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>10</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../10/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started this data science journey to transition into an exciting new field from engineering. I compared several bootcamps prior to selecting TripleTen and it was the best fit for me due to the flexible study schedule, breadth of the curriculum, continuous support from the community managers & tutors, and affordability.I liked TripleTen's interactive platform with real-world tasks in each sprint, which makes it easy to see the value in the material, and how it can be applied to solving data science problems. The sprint projects are also real-world tasks, optimized to focus on material from the sprint and put the knowledge to practice.  TripleTen's comprehensive data science program has helped me learn Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, Git, and machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised for classification and regression tasks. Even though support is readily available from tutors during office hours and quick-to-respond community managers, I encourage you to challenge yourself and not ask for help until you've really tried as this will make the solution more rewarding and memorable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ahmad Hijazi"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I'm still a student at TripleTen, and I've gone through 9 of the 16 total sprints so far. From the very first one, the information was presented in a clear and effective manner. The theory is comprehensive without being overwhelming, and the exercises are great reinforcement of each of the theory segments. The projects at the end of each sprint are direct applications of the information presented in the chapter, with just enough challenge to push your skills and solidify your learning. There's just enough guidance to let you figure out things own your own, or get help from tutors. Each sprint builds on past material very well, advancing your knowledge as the program goes along. The community support and engagement is great as well. Community managers and tutors are super responsive and helpful; the scheduled office hours for students to have a planned time to ask for help and questions are very useful as well. The tutors are very knowledgeable; they're always willing to help, and explain ideas beyond the scope of projects or sprints.TripleTen has been a great experience so far, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get into software engineering.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cody O'Brien"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-06-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am a current student of Triple Ten (Formerly Practicum) and I have to say I knew going into this bootcamp after being mesmerized by the first free sprint that I loved doing this. I underestimated the intense core of what is involved, and while I still am loving this bootcamp, rest assured you will work hard to achieve the results you are looking for. I love my Community Manager- Dina, she is awesome and works with you so well, and there are some amazing tutors almost always available. Sometimes I have a hard time following the lessons and studying in Theory, but I do eventually get it, and now entering Sprint 2. I cannot wait to see what I will continue to learn. SUPER INTENSE = SUPER SATISFACTION here, and its so far worth every penny I have paid for my tuition. I have no doubts if you want the best engineering learning, this is the bootcamp to choose. I ALSO have learned so much about myself like how I am teaching myself to pay more attention to syntax and grammar, trust me it matters! I have learned how satisfying it is to finish something even if there are a few things I missed, I can go back and in real time learn how to not repeat them. It takes a while to get some of the concepts, but I like the way Practicum has laid the Sprints out, even early into the bootcamp. Thanks Triple Ten!

I was looking for a bootcamp that could fulfill a few things. I wanted it to be a strong bootcamp, with flexible hours. I work a full time job, and many other commitments, so finding something that was flexible was one of my top priorities. Many other bootcamps require you to join a live coding class, which I think is extremely helpful, but hard to commit to when you have other responsibilities. TripleTen allows me to work on my own schedule. I also find the coursework to be extremely strong, and progresses from easily to very difficult, which allows you to become accustomed to the platform, coding and learning. The community of learners is super strong helpful and encouraging. I have started close relationships with other students which has allowed me to 1) grow my network, 2) make friends in the field, and 3) get support from other students. We have created a community where we come together to support each other. The tutors are super helpful and are often available at many different hours of the day.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marlon Nunez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-01T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I have completed the first third of the Data Science Bootcamp as of today. I decided to go with TripleTen (Originally Practicum when I was researching programs) after several weeks of investigating various online Data Science Bootcamps. One of the biggest selling points for me was the opportunity to do work for a real company while in the program. I also did the introduction to coding module and found the UI to be very easy to use and navigate. So far my experience has been excellent. The material has been engaging and challenging, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The set up on Discord is great. For each new module you are added to that module's discord channel and you can see the questions previously asked by students and the answers from tutors and other students. This saves time and prevents you from having to ask the same question as others. I would say I spend around the 20 hours per week that TripleTen said I should expect at the beginning of the program. I find it best to put in at least an hour a day during the week and several hours on the weekends. Overall I feel like it is a great program and I highly recommend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Levy"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I decided to start learning Data Science because solving problems interest me.  I'd like to have a work from home position where what I do uniquely helps the company.  I have an analytical personality and I am good at analyzing details.The training platform is helpful because there is theoretical learning.  Like it explains the new topics and then backs it up with code for you to do the work of what you just learned.  The projects give you a chance to work on real world business topics that you might actually do in the field.  The tutors are helpful when you can get one.  I don't like that its challenging to casually get explaination for things you may not understand.   Code reviewers are tough, sometimes they give a hard time.  Community managers are as helpful as can be.  The other classmates are golden, and a great support system.\nI am learning new skills and concepts I never even thought of, and I think I will be able actually do the skills needed.

I've been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React at the moment. I'm hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get \"stuck\" or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can't make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They're such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can't comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an \"apiary\" or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven't known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn't been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don't really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I'm not sure if it's because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it's necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.\nOverall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I'm hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kiffany Francis"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"About two years ago I decided to shift my career into the tech industry. At that time, I was working in a job I didn't like, and it presented the perfect opportunity for me to pursue further education. After researching various boot camps online, I came across an advertisement for TripleTen (formerly Practicum), and I decided to enroll in their Data Analytics course. I'm not exactly sure why, but something about this boot camp felt right—the comprehensive information provided, the well-structured curriculum, also the encouraging call I received from their representative. I must admit that the course was very challenging and intense for me, but it was definitely worth the effort to complete it. I have a tendency to take things very seriously, and there were times when I made mistakes or failed to seek help in advance, which may have taken longer to complete the course. Nevertheless, I persevered, learned a lot, and gained valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. The course also provided real-world projects that enhanced my resume. Through this experience, I learned that it's okay when things don't go as planned, and it's acceptable to make mistakes and move forward when necessary. I am grateful for the incredible support team, code reviewers, tutors, and the welcoming community. I want to express my appreciation to my exceptional community manager, Marina, who has been extremely supportive and always there for me. Altogether, my experience with TripleTen has been excellent so far, and I have no doubts that if you are seeking the best engineering education, this is the boot camp to choose from.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elmira Sapanova"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I would like to start this review of why I chose TripleTen as the bootcamp to learn how to become a Data Analyst. Before joining TripleTen, I had tried to study the different subjects that are provided within the course, like learning Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL and Python. But learning these subjects on my own proved to be a very difficult task and could not find the time or the structure to study these subjects correctly and to understand them was an even harder task. As I started to review and investigate different bootcamps, I came across TripleTen. I was immediately convinced as it had very positive reviews from previous students, the price point was very reasonable (with different payment options) and the course completion of 6 months was very appealing. Before beginning, you have a phone conference with a TripleTen representative that explains the course in detail and it helped me to make the decision to enter this bootcamp. Upon entering, you are given a start date and an orientation, that answers any doubts that you might have about the bootcamp. The structure of the course is very adaptable to anyone. I am currently working a full-time job, from 8am - 5pm, and always found the time to study either during my lunch breaks or after work. I also structured study time during the weekends so that I would not fall behind. In total, I would say that I would study around 15-20 hours per week. The bootcamp is structured in a very reasonable and workable way. You first are given material to read and review about each subject, like Excel/Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, etc. During theoretical learning, you are also given review task which cement the learning material further. After every sprint (how the course is divided, about 2-3 weeks of learning), you are to complete a project about what you learned. The projects to me were my favorite thing about the bootcamp, as they require you to apply all of your knowledge that you learned during the sprint. The projects are also the most fundamental part of the bootcamp, in my opinion, because it is the evidence that you learned the material and is what you are able to present to future employers. Tips and advice for anyone thinking of joining this bootcamp is to not be discouraged if any of the material appears to be harder than expected. If it were easy, anybody would do it. Also, the support from tutors and project manager is always available and they are always willing to help and guide you through any difficulties. Another thing to consider it to always make the time, there will be days when you will feel overwhelmed, but trust me when I say that it is possible and by putting your mind to it, it is always possible. Also, the times are very flexible and even working full-time, I never fell behind in any sprint. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my time with TripleTen and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about getting into the tech industry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jose Valenzuela"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-23T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen has a good online community with study buddies 5 days a week, and teambuilding if you take advantage of opportunities with cohort members. The community is one of the best parts. Tutors seem less available once you're in the program for months. They also want specific questions verses,\" I don't understand, please help\" approach. This program is good if you have a bit of gumption about yourself and some sort of interest in the subject of study you choose. The whole point is to get a job in the field, I have just 3 months left to finish the 9 month program. The work itself is challenging. I came in not knowing much of programming. The data science field requires knowledge of coding, and a certain field of mathematics. If a person likes solving problems this could be good for them. I like how now I am in the part of the program that now starts to apply data science to practical business use. There are a lot of things to learn before getting to practical usage. Another part of the program that I do like is there are deadlines. I personally need deadlines to work toward for personal goal meeting and to get a logistical view point of attaining goals. Again the work can be a bit challenging but I have surprised myself with gaining a lot of skill and knowledge in the field. The point is to get a good job in the field which I have not reached yet. The online staff at Tripleten is helpful, and the tutors are good, not great, but good-- definitely not bad. Lastly, as you learn --you code; you read theory, you see examples, then you code-- this does help when you have to make the code work as you go along.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brandi Booth"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
