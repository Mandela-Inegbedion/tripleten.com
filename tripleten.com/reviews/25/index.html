Despite a 10-year career in real estate, my background in engineering and love for mathematics have always steered my interests towards technology. After extensive research into various educational pathways, including reputable universities and boot camps, I concluded that TripleTen&#39;s program offers the most comprehensive curriculum to pivot into tech, particularly in the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. Additionally, I am supplementing my learning with courses from edX and conducting thorough research on each topic to gain a well-rounded understanding. My dedication extends to utilizing every spare moment outside family time, work, and personal care, investing 20 to 40 hours weekly into studying. The project-based approach of TripleTen&#39;s program has not only been educational but also immensely enjoyable, allowing me to integrate learning aspects and iteratively enhance my projects.The support from the learning team has been invaluable, especially during instances of technical difficulties where immediate assistance is readily available through chat. The most rewarding part of this experience has been grasping the conceptual and practical applications of data science, largely attributed to the integration of industry practices shared by practicing data scientists.Entering this field without a professional network, the support and resources provided have been crucial. My advice to anyone on a similar path is to approach learning with enthusiasm, leveraging every available resource, including Google and ChatGPT, to deepen understanding. Emphasizing conceptual clarity over minutiae, such as syntax, can significantly enhance your learning experience. My journey with TripleTen has been incredibly positive, earning it my highest recommendation: five stars.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Justin DelaFlor&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712606400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149439615?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68370#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Wanted to get into tech/software-engineering and jumped into the bootcamp. I am in sprint 10 out of 15. This course is very organized with the way they teach and way they set up assignments and projects. The discord allows you to connect and ask for help from a multitude of tutors who are all friendly and welcoming to ask any questions. They are patient and go beyond their way to help. So far the experience has been great. I will say that this bootcamp is good if you&#39;re really self-driven and self-taught type of person. Especially if you&#39;re working a full 9-5 alongside this program. I find days exhausting and tiring so you really have to commit to wanting to dive into this space. I recommend spending more hours outside of what is expected to fully feel satisfied and excel from my experience. Overall, I have been loving this experience and excited to learn more as i finish up. I encounter this program through finding their ads on youtube and after enough time I looked into and say that it seemed enticing. Feedback has been good at all spectrums of the program.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Robert Pickett&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712692800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68413#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen offers remote data analyst training that&#39;s accessible and effective. They can help you prepare for data analytics certification and a career in business intelligence.\nTripleTen stands out because of its focus on community and support.

The curriculum is challenging and I have learned a lot. I am currently a 2/3rds or the way through and am pushing for the finish line.It could be great if they ironed out a couple of kinks. I&#39;ve come across a couple of issues with project requirements changing without updates, and having to implement code in the project that I didn&#39;t learn in the brief that made it frustrating and cause extra hours to code the project.I really enjoy coding and I&#39;m happy that this platform exists so I can develop my skills as a Software Engineer. Thank you for all the hard work it took to make this course and please continue to improve for future students.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jackson Dana&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712779200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to enroll in the TripleTen Data Science program to pivot into a new, innovative, and in-demand career. I was hoping to secure a well-paying, engaging, and cutting-edge job in data science. TripleTen seemed like the perfect choice for my coding journey due to their extensive support, custom coding platform, job search assistance, and the money-back guarantee if I couldn’t find a job. The positive reviews also played a significant role in my decision.During a typical week of learning at TripleTen, I dedicated several hours every day to reading the chapter information, doing the corresponding assignments, and researching deeper into many of the topics covered. During project sprints, my time was dedicated to systematically working through each part of the project, from exploratory data analysis and data visualization to meeting the project’s goal.The interactive platform and the projects were definitely my favorite parts of this program. Having a dedicated coding platform made it easy to write and run code without needing to worry about having the computing resources on my own computer or needing to install necessary libraries. The projects helped me gain confidence in applying what I learned to a hypothetical but realistic project that a company might really have.Towards the end of the program, I encountered a serious bug on the coding platform. Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Megumi Kajigaya&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712865600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68440#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently in the QA Engineering program at TripleTen and just started my 7th sprint (out of 9). To give you my background, I work a full-time job and do not have any previous experience in tech. So far, I am very happy with the program. The course material is engaging with visuals and divided into small lessons, which I appreciate because it feels a little more casual and relaxed than reading textbooks. What I like about TripleTen is the great career support and the community, in addition to the course itself. Through seminars, one-on-one meetings with a career advisor, and reading career chapters, I have learned steps to network effectively, how to utilize my LinkedIn and other social media to stand out, and helpful tips for interviews etc. I got to meet some fellow students via discord and meetings, and appreciate how we encourage each other. Tutors are great resources when I struggle with studying. You can ask them questions during their online “office hours” and via the discord channel any time. That being said, I feel that some things are up to the students. I tried to spend at least 1-2 hours every day when I started the program, but I eventually needed to slow down because studying on top of keeping my life together and working full-time feels tough sometimes. Fortunately, the program allows you to study at your own pace, and the success manager is accepting if you need to delay your deadlines. I am planning on expanding my network and meeting new professionals out there even though it is out of my comfort zone because I heard that getting a job with no tech experience can take an effort. I have seen a few people voicing that the schedules for meetings and tutor hours do not align with their work schedules (especially for people who work night shifts). But again, the community is very supportive and there for your success. Overall, I feel that TripleTen is a great program, especially for those transitioning into tech. If you choose this program, I would recommend utilizing their support and getting engaged with the opportunities they offer as much as possible.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Austria&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1712865600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68441#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently a BIA (Business Intelligence Analyst) student, where I am on sprint 5 out of 7.  I am currently an math educator looking to switch into a tech position once the school year ends. When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Krystle Ta&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713124800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155707000?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68473#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After graduating from University, I spent 9 years as a Web Developer then went on a hiatus and became a stay at home mum. I am now looking to return to the tech workforce so I started looking for online bootcamps to boost my confidence, refresh my skills, learn something new and motivate me to get back into it! TripleTen was the perfect fit. The highlights of the Software Engineering course that attracted me the most are the following:It is fully remote and self-pacedI was able to allow my studies to work around my hectic schedule. I also have three young boys and I co-own a restaurant therefore I am always very busy! I still chose to commit to completing this course because I am very motivated to continue my career in tech. With all the lessons online I can study from anywhere and at any time. This was very ideal for me and convenient.Course contentMost of my previous experience was back-end development. What also attracted me to TripleTen&#39;s course was the course content and the fact they cover full-stack technologies. Their offerings provide a great foundation for pursuing both front and back end roles.Career advice and assistanceOne of the highlights of TripleTen&#39;s offerings is providing career support and assistance. Throughout the topics I am learning, TripleTen provides career advice, offers one on one consultations with career advisors and assistance with preparing for job searches when you are ready to put yourself out there and land a job in tech!Amazing community and supportWhat is truly comforting is the amount of support you get from tutors, senior students, fellow students, success managers and career advisors. If you are stuck on a lesson or project there are a lot of resources that will help out. Success managers check in on you and make sure you are feeling well and are on track.Student participation and externshipsThere are also opportunities to participate in further activities such as Code Jams and further along in the course you have an opportunity to complete an externship with companies they have partnered with, which will further prepare you for entering the tech workforce.Those are some of the highlights for me, since I began the course four months ago I am much more confident and motivated to get back into tech!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;William Hollis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1713124800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68486#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

I think that they really spell things out for you without holding your hand through it. It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful.

currently enrolled in TripleTen&#39;s software engineering bootcamp and I have no complaints.  So, to start from the beginning I decided to start learning Software Engineering for a few reasons.  I originally graduated from SUNY Oneonta which is a New York State University and got my bachelors in Business Administration.  After graduating with this degree I started looking for jobs.  I applied on LinkedIn, on company websites, and reached out to friends but in the end after months and months of searching I got no replies to jobs I wanted.  The only jobs that would answer me were door to door sales jobs but being the quiet person I am, that was not for me at all.  So I then started to work at my neighbor&#39;s construction company and after working there for a few months of long hours and 60+ hour weeks I decided I needed a change. I began researching for new careers that I found appealing.  I had many different thoughts on potential careers and at the end the career that made the most sense for me was software engineering.  The reason software engineering was my top pick was because of how flexible some software engineering jobs can be.  Also, when I came across it I found it to be kind of like a puzzle and I’ve always been a big fan of puzzles whether it is playing sudoku or solving a Rubik&#39;s cube.  After researching different ways on which I can potentially become a software engineer.  I stumbled across bootcamps and after examining many thoroughly I found TripleTen.  What stood out to me with TripleTen was how they provide externships and the reviews were outstanding.  The fact that TripleTen provides externships alone is a key factor as to why I decided to join.  Every other boot camp I found didn’t offer anything close to it.While enrolled in TripleTen and working pretty much a full-time job sometimes it can be challenging to balance it all when working on a hard project.  However, once you get in the groove of things it isn’t too bad.  What I like to do during weekdays after work is to try to get in two to three hours of studying or just something related to what I am learning at the time, whether it is a side project, researching, or watching youtube videos.  Then on weekends or if I am off from work I like to spend upwards of four hours studying or working on a project.  What I found works for days when I am going to be coding for a while is I like to take breaks and do something productive after maybe an hour of studying like go for a walk, cook something, or workout.    In total I like to try to aim for 15-20 hours of studying per week.  Also, the good thing about TripleTen is the fact that if you are falling behind for any reason they allow you to take time off of the course.  I have taken a couple breaks off of the course.  One was for a vacation and another was to work on some projects on the side and look back at what I have learned in the previous lesson.  I think TripleTen has many features that greatly benefit its students.  For example, the tutors, the discord, the success managers, code review, and the projects.  The tutors are great as you can schedule biweekly tutoring sessions to either help with projects or with any material you are struggling with and let me tell you they are way more helpful than I would’ve thought.  Some tutors also hold office hours which is a scheduled time per week when anyone can join and pop in and out to ask questions.  They also have these like 1-5 times a day on average which is amazing.  Also, the discord is a great help.  Sometimes when I am working on a project I have trouble with some of the work and I send in anyone&#39;s questions in discord and either a tutor will answer or a student will answer pretty quickly.  The discord is also good for just chatting about anything with other students.  If you join TripleTen you will also be assigned a success manager who helps keep you on pace with the work assigned.  They are the person who you go to if you need to request an extension or a break and it really helps to make the learning experience smoother having all these sources or help.  The code reviewers have helped me on every project.  Once you submit your project the code reviewers will make notes in your code for areas to improve or areas that need to be changed which is a huge help.  Lastly, the projects are a great time.  When working on the projects it is the coolest experience seeing yourself build entire websites that you would;ve never thought you would be able to do.  I believe that TripleTen has helped a huge amount with my goals of becoming a software engineer with these features.  They even offer career help where they guide you on how to build your LinkedIn and how to basically reach out for jobs and eventually how to take an interview to land those jobs.Some tips I would give to someone who is new and just starting their coding journey I would definitely make sure that it is something that you can see yourself doing.  For people that want to take this path I would definitely recommend the TripleTens software engineer course.  I have been very surprised with all that the bootcamp offers, especially at its cheap price.  Before purchasing the course I would first recommend that you talk to someone on the phone about the course to get a better understanding before fully committing to it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course

data-v-b9cc090d>February 2024 I started the data science bootcamp through TripleTen, driven by a passion for AI, machine learning, and the technical aspects of computer science. Despite a 10-year career in real estate, my background in engineering and love for mathematics have always steered my interests towards te... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>chnology. After extensive research into various educational pathways, including reputable universities and boot camps, I concluded that TripleTen&#39;s program offers the most comprehensive curriculum to pivot into tech, particularly in the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. Additionally, I am supplementing my learning with courses from edX and conducting thorough research on each topic to gain a well-rounded understanding. My dedication extends to utilizing every spare moment outside family time, work, and personal care, investing 20 to 40 hours weekly into studying. The project-based approach of TripleTen&#39;s program has not only been educational but also immensely enjoyable, allowing me to integrate learning aspects and iteratively enhance my projects.The support from the learning team has been invaluable, especially during instances of technical difficulties where immediate assistance is readily available through chat. The most rewarding part of this experience has been grasping the conceptual and practical applications of data science, largely attributed to the integration of industry practices shared by practicing data scientists.Entering this field without a professional network, the support and resources provided have been crucial. My advice to anyone on a similar path is to approach learning with enthusiasm, leveraging every available resource, including Google and ChatGPT, to deepen understanding. Emphasizing conceptual clarity over minutiae, such as syntax, can significantly enhance your learning experience. My journey with TripleTen has been incredibly positive, earning it my highest recommendation: five stars. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149439615?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Justin DelaFlor</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Wanted to get into tech/software-engineering and jumped into the bootcamp.

I recommend spending more hours outside of what is expected to fully feel satisfied and excel from my experience. Overall, I have been loving this experience and excited to learn more as i finish up.

The positive reviews also played a significant role in my decision.During a typical week of learning at TripleTen, I dedicated several hours every day to reading the chapter information, doing the corresponding assignments, and researching deeper into many of the topics covered. During project sprints, my time was dedicated to systematically working through each part of the project, from exploratory data analysis and data visualization to meeting the project’s goal.The interactive platform and the projects were definitely my favorite parts of this program. Having a dedicated coding platform made it easy to write and run code without needing to worry about having the computing resources on my own computer or needing to install necessary libraries. The projects helped me gain confidence in applying what I learned to a hypothetical but realistic project that a company might really have.Towards the end of the program, I encountered a serious bug on the coding platform. Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Megumi Kajigaya</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am currently in the QA Engineering program at TripleTen and just started my 7th sprint (out of 9).

The course material is engaging with visuals and divided i... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>nto small lessons, which I appreciate because it feels a little more casual and relaxed than reading textbooks. What I like about TripleTen is the great career support and the community, in addition to the course itself. Through seminars, one-on-one meetings with a career advisor, and reading career chapters, I have learned steps to network effectively, how to utilize my LinkedIn and other social media to stand out, and helpful tips for interviews etc. I got to meet some fellow students via discord and meetings, and appreciate how we encourage each other. Tutors are great resources when I struggle with studying. You can ask them questions during their online “office hours” and via the discord channel any time. That being said, I feel that some things are up to the students. I tried to spend at least 1-2 hours every day when I started the program, but I eventually needed to slow down because studying on top of keeping my life together and working full-time feels tough sometimes. Fortunately, the program allows you to study at your own pace, and the success manager is accepting if you need to delay your deadlines. I am planning on expanding my network and meeting new professionals out there even though it is out of my comfort zone because I heard that getting a job with no tech experience can take an effort. I have seen a few people voicing that the schedules for meetings and tutor hours do not align with their work schedules (especially for people who work night shifts). But again, the community is very supportive and there for your success. Overall, I feel that TripleTen is a great program, especially for those transitioning into tech. If you choose this program, I would recommend utilizing their support and getting engaged with the opportunities they offer as much as possible. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68440#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Mike Austria</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I am currently a BIA (Business Intelligence Analyst) student, where I am on sprint 5 out of 7.  I am currently an math educator looking to switch into a tech position once the school year ends. When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68441#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155707000?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Krystle Ta</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>After graduating from University, I spent 9 years as a Web Developer then went on a hiatus and became a stay at home mum.

TripleTen was the perfect fit. The highlights of the Software Engineering course that attracted me the most are the following:It is fully remote and self-pacedI was able to allow my studies to work around my hectic schedule. I also have three young boys and I co-own a restaurant therefore I am always very busy! I still chose to commit to completing this course because I am very motivated to continue my career in tech. With all the lessons online I can study from anywhere and at any time. This was very ideal for me and convenient.Course contentMost of my previous experience was back-end development. What also attracted me to TripleTen&#39;s course was the course content and the fact they cover full-stack technologies. Their offerings provide a great foundation for pursuing both front and back end roles.Career advice and assistanceOne of the highlights of TripleTen&#39;s offerings is providing career support and assistance. Throughout the topics I am learning, TripleTen provides career advice, offers one on one consultations with career advisors and assistance with preparing for job searches when you are ready to put yourself out there and land a job in tech!Amazing community and supportWhat is truly comforting is the amount of support you get from tutors, senior students, fellow students, success managers and career advisors. If you are stuck on a lesson or project there are a lot of resources that will help out. Success managers check in on you and make sure you are feeling well and are on track.Student participation and externshipsThere are also opportunities to participate in further activities such as Code Jams and further along in the course you have an opportunity to complete an externship with companies they have partnered with, which will further prepare you for entering the tech workforce.Those are some of the highlights for me, since I began the course four months ago I am much more confident and motivated to get back into tech! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68473#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>William Hollis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

the beginning I decided to start learning Software Engineering for a few reasons.  I originally graduated from SUNY Oneonta which is a New York State University and got my bachelors in Bu... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>siness Administration.  After graduating with this degree I started looking for jobs.  I applied on LinkedIn, on company websites, and reached out to friends but in the end after months and months of searching I got no replies to jobs I wanted.  The only jobs that would answer me were door to door sales jobs but being the quiet person I am, that was not for me at all.  So I then started to work at my neighbor&#39;s construction company and after working there for a few months of long hours and 60+ hour weeks I decided I needed a change. I began researching for new careers that I found appealing.  I had many different thoughts on potential careers and at the end the career that made the most sense for me was software engineering.  The reason software engineering was my top pick was because of how flexible some software engineering jobs can be.  Also, when I came across it I found it to be kind of like a puzzle and I’ve always been a big fan of puzzles whether it is playing sudoku or solving a Rubik&#39;s cube.  After researching different ways on which I can potentially become a software engineer.  I stumbled across bootcamps and after examining many thoroughly I found TripleTen.  What stood out to me with TripleTen was how they provide externships and the reviews were outstanding.  The fact that TripleTen provides externships alone is a key factor as to why I decided to join.  Every other boot camp I found didn’t offer anything close to it.While enrolled in TripleTen and working pretty much a full-time job sometimes it can be challenging to balance it all when working on a hard project.  However, once you get in the groove of things it isn’t too bad.  What I like to do during weekdays after work is to try to get in two to three hours of studying or just something related to what I am learning at the time, whether it is a side project, researching, or watching youtube videos.  Then on weekends or if I am off from work I like to spend upwards of four hours studying or working on a project.  What I found works for days when I am going to be coding for a while is I like to take breaks and do something productive after maybe an hour of studying like go for a walk, cook something, or workout.    In total I like to try to aim for 15-20 hours of studying per week.  Also, the good thing about TripleTen is the fact that if you are falling behind for any reason they allow you to take time off of the course.  I have taken a couple breaks off of the course.  One was for a vacation and another was to work on some projects on the side and look back at what I have learned in the previous lesson.  I think TripleTen has many features that greatly benefit its students.  For example, the tutors, the discord, the success managers, code review, and the projects.  The tutors are great as you can schedule biweekly tutoring sessions to either help with projects or with any material you are struggling with and let me tell you they are way more helpful than I would’ve thought.  Some tutors also hold office hours which is a scheduled time per week when anyone can join and pop in and out to ask questions.  They also have these like 1-5 times a day on average which is amazing.  Also, the discord is a great help.  Sometimes when I am working on a project I have trouble with some of the work and I send in anyone&#39;s questions in discord and either a tutor will answer or a student will answer pretty quickly.  The discord is also good for just chatting about anything with other students.  If you join TripleTen you will also be assigned a success manager who helps keep you on pace with the work assigned.  They are the person who you go to if you need to request an extension or a break and it really helps to make the learning experience smoother having all these sources or help.  The code reviewers have helped me on every project.  Once you submit your project the code reviewers will make notes in your code for areas to improve or areas that need to be changed which is a huge help.  Lastly, the projects are a great time.  When working on the projects it is the coolest experience seeing yourself build entire websites that you would;ve never thought you would be able to do.  I believe that TripleTen has helped a huge amount with my goals of becoming a software engineer with these features.  They even offer career help where they guide you on how to build your LinkedIn and how to basically reach out for jobs and eventually how to take an interview to land those jobs.Some tips I would give to someone who is new and just starting their coding journey I would definitely make sure that it is something that you can see yourself doing.  For people that want to take this path I would definitely recommend the TripleTens software engineer course.  I have been very surprised with all that the bootcamp offers, especially at its cheap price.  Before purchasing the course I would first recommend that you talk to someone on the phone about the course to get a better understanding before fully committing to it. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a

The discord allows you to connect and ask for help from a multitude of tutors who are all friendly and welcoming to ask any questions. They are patient and go beyond their way to help. So far the experience has been great. I will say that this bootcamp is good if you're really self-driven and self-taught type of person. Especially if you're working a full 9-5 alongside this program. I find days exhausting and tiring so you really have to commit to wanting to dive into this space. I recommend spending more hours outside of what is expected to fully feel satisfied and excel from my experience. Overall, I have been loving this experience and excited to learn more as i finish up. I encounter this program through finding their ads on youtube and after enough time I looked into and say that it seemed enticing.

I've come across a couple of issues with project requirements changing without updates, and having to implement code in the project that I didn't learn in the brief that made it frustrating and cause extra hours to code the project.I really enjoy coding and I'm happy that this platform exists so I can develop my skills as a Software Engineer.

I was hoping to secure a well-paying, engaging, and cutting-edge job in data science. TripleTen seemed like the perfect choice for my coding journey due to their extensive support, custom coding platform, job search assistance, and the money-back guarantee if I couldn’t find a job. The positive reviews also played a significant role in my decision.During a typical week of learning at TripleTen, I dedicated several hours every day to reading the chapter information, doing the corresponding assignments, and researching deeper into many of the topics covered. During project sprints, my time was dedicated to systematically working through each part of the project, from exploratory data analysis and data visualization to meeting the project’s goal.The interactive platform and the projects were definitely my favorite parts of this program. Having a dedicated coding platform made it easy to write and run code without needing to worry about having the computing resources on my own computer or needing to install necessary libraries. The projects helped me gain confidence in applying what I learned to a hypothetical but realistic project that a company might really have.Towards the end of the program, I encountered a serious bug on the coding platform. Despite submitting correct neural network code, my submissions were not being accepted, which hindered my progress. However, the tutors were friendly and apologetic, promptly contacting the relevant tech support to resolve the issue. This happened two or three times, but once the issue was resolved, I was able to proceed freely with one or two weeks lost. Assuming these technical issues were not resolved by now, take this into consideration when looking at this program. In terms of value for money, I believe the bootcamp was worth the cost. It’s an excellent option for those looking to quickly gain new skills or transition into a new field. However, it’s important to note that this program is largely self-paced and requires a significant amount of independent learning.My advice to those just starting their coding journey is to ensure that you can be an independent and self-paced learner. Create a strict schedule to allow just that to occur, without giving in to the temptation to cut corners or not dive into topics to the degree needed.Overall, I would rate this bootcamp 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a great program for those who are comfortable with self-paced learning and are looking to quickly propel themselves into the field of data science.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jackson Dana"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am currently in the QA Engineering program at TripleTen and just started my 7th sprint (out of 9). To give you my background, I work a full-time job and do not have any previous experience in tech. So far, I am very happy with the program. The course material is engaging with visuals and divided into small lessons, which I appreciate because it feels a little more casual and relaxed than reading textbooks. What I like about TripleTen is the great career support and the community, in addition to the course itself. Through seminars, one-on-one meetings with a career advisor, and reading career chapters, I have learned steps to network effectively, how to utilize my LinkedIn and other social media to stand out, and helpful tips for interviews etc. I got to meet some fellow students via discord and meetings, and appreciate how we encourage each other. Tutors are great resources when I struggle with studying. You can ask them questions during their online “office hours” and via the discord channel any time. That being said, I feel that some things are up to the students. I tried to spend at least 1-2 hours every day when I started the program, but I eventually needed to slow down because studying on top of keeping my life together and working full-time feels tough sometimes. Fortunately, the program allows you to study at your own pace, and the success manager is accepting if you need to delay your deadlines. I am planning on expanding my network and meeting new professionals out there even though it is out of my comfort zone because I heard that getting a job with no tech experience can take an effort. I have seen a few people voicing that the schedules for meetings and tutor hours do not align with their work schedules (especially for people who work night shifts). But again, the community is very supportive and there for your success. Overall, I feel that TripleTen is a great program, especially for those transitioning into tech. If you choose this program, I would recommend utilizing their support and getting engaged with the opportunities they offer as much as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Megumi Kajigaya"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am currently a BIA (Business Intelligence Analyst) student, where I am on sprint 5 out of 7.  I am currently an math educator looking to switch into a tech position once the school year ends. When checking out their website, TripleTen requires you to take a career quiz to see where you best fit.  They ask questions based on what you like to learn and what kind of career you are looking for long term.  Once you are matched, a representative contacts you to tell you more about the program. In this program, I am learning how to be successful with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and soon Power BI.  The sprints are helpful in breaking down the basics of programs, and how it can be utilized.  You do not have to pay to have the programs in your computer, as the sprints tell you how to install them on the computer with no charge. There are also videos in certain sprints that explain how a certain function can be done.  at the end of sprints, there are projects that apply what you learned during your time, but also encourage you to explore other ways you can utilize the programs.  This is a way to work on your critical thinking skills.  Once you submit a project, it takes up to 24 hours to get it reviewed and approved.  However, the longest I have waited was 12 hours for approval.  The comments from the reviewers are also encouraging, but if there is something missing from the project, they allow you to make edits with the same project, so you would not have to do it again.  Once the projects are completed in each sprint, they have lessons on how to land a job as well as how to work on your professionalism. The lessons that they provide include how to write a resume, professionalism, and communication skills.  TripleTen also has tutors available via Discord and have working hours where they can assist you with any project.  Within the chats, they have live chats on career building and have speakers to talk about how to land a career in the tech field.  They also provide a calendar that keeps you on track of when the projects are due.  They also do check in with you to see how you are progressing in the program, and are super friendly whether you are succeeding or struggling.  The calendar is very useful to give you an idea of how long each sprint should take, and how many hours should be spent on each lesson.  If you cannot meet a due date (because of personal reasons), they also offer project extensions, where they push your due date to give you ample time to complete a project.   Overall, this has been a great experience so far and have been happy with my progress in TripleTen.  It may seem like it is fast paced and you do have to commit a certain amount of time and dedication to the program, but it is a great learning experience in a short time and if you are looking for an immediate career change.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike Austria"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After graduating from University, I spent 9 years as a Web Developer then went on a hiatus and became a stay at home mum. I am now looking to return to the tech workforce so I started looking for online bootcamps to boost my confidence, refresh my skills, learn something new and motivate me to get back into it! TripleTen was the perfect fit. The highlights of the Software Engineering course that attracted me the most are the following:It is fully remote and self-pacedI was able to allow my studies to work around my hectic schedule. I also have three young boys and I co-own a restaurant therefore I am always very busy! I still chose to commit to completing this course because I am very motivated to continue my career in tech. With all the lessons online I can study from anywhere and at any time. This was very ideal for me and convenient.Course contentMost of my previous experience was back-end development. What also attracted me to TripleTen's course was the course content and the fact they cover full-stack technologies. Their offerings provide a great foundation for pursuing both front and back end roles.Career advice and assistanceOne of the highlights of TripleTen's offerings is providing career support and assistance. Throughout the topics I am learning, TripleTen provides career advice, offers one on one consultations with career advisors and assistance with preparing for job searches when you are ready to put yourself out there and land a job in tech!Amazing community and supportWhat is truly comforting is the amount of support you get from tutors, senior students, fellow students, success managers and career advisors. If you are stuck on a lesson or project there are a lot of resources that will help out. Success managers check in on you and make sure you are feeling well and are on track.Student participation and externshipsThere are also opportunities to participate in further activities such as Code Jams and further along in the course you have an opportunity to complete an externship with companies they have partnered with, which will further prepare you for entering the tech workforce.Those are some of the highlights for me, since I began the course four months ago I am much more confident and motivated to get back into tech!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Krystle Ta"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

currently enrolled in TripleTen's software engineering bootcamp and I have no complaints.  So, to start from the beginning I decided to start learning Software Engineering for a few reasons.  I originally graduated from SUNY Oneonta which is a New York State University and got my bachelors in Business Administration.  After graduating with this degree I started looking for jobs.  I applied on LinkedIn, on company websites, and reached out to friends but in the end after months and months of searching I got no replies to jobs I wanted.  The only jobs that would answer me were door to door sales jobs but being the quiet person I am, that was not for me at all.  So I then started to work at my neighbor's construction company and after working there for a few months of long hours and 60+ hour weeks I decided I needed a change. I began researching for new careers that I found appealing.  I had many different thoughts on potential careers and at the end the career that made the most sense for me was software engineering.  The reason software engineering was my top pick was because of how flexible some software engineering jobs can be.  Also, when I came across it I found it to be kind of like a puzzle and I’ve always been a big fan of puzzles whether it is playing sudoku or solving a Rubik's cube.  After researching different ways on which I can potentially become a software engineer.  I stumbled across bootcamps and after examining many thoroughly I found TripleTen.  What stood out to me with TripleTen was how they provide externships and the reviews were outstanding.  The fact that TripleTen provides externships alone is a key factor as to why I decided to join.  Every other boot camp I found didn’t offer anything close to it.While enrolled in TripleTen and working pretty much a full-time job sometimes it can be challenging to balance it all when working on a hard project.  However, once you get in the groove of things it isn’t too bad.  What I like to do during weekdays after work is to try to get in two to three hours of studying or just something related to what I am learning at the time, whether it is a side project, researching, or watching youtube videos.  Then on weekends or if I am off from work I like to spend upwards of four hours studying or working on a project.  What I found works for days when I am going to be coding for a while is I like to take breaks and do something productive after maybe an hour of studying like go for a walk, cook something, or workout.    In total I like to try to aim for 15-20 hours of studying per week.  Also, the good thing about TripleTen is the fact that if you are falling behind for any reason they allow you to take time off of the course.  I have taken a couple breaks off of the course.  One was for a vacation and another was to work on some projects on the side and look back at what I have learned in the previous lesson.  I think TripleTen has many features that greatly benefit its students.  For example, the tutors, the discord, the success managers, code review, and the projects.  The tutors are great as you can schedule biweekly tutoring sessions to either help with projects or with any material you are struggling with and let me tell you they are way more helpful than I would’ve thought.  Some tutors also hold office hours which is a scheduled time per week when anyone can join and pop in and out to ask questions.  They also have these like 1-5 times a day on average which is amazing.  Also, the discord is a great help.  Sometimes when I am working on a project I have trouble with some of the work and I send in anyone's questions in discord and either a tutor will answer or a student will answer pretty quickly.  The discord is also good for just chatting about anything with other students.  If you join TripleTen you will also be assigned a success manager who helps keep you on pace with the work assigned.  They are the person who you go to if you need to request an extension or a break and it really helps to make the learning experience smoother having all these sources or help.  The code reviewers have helped me on every project.  Once you submit your project the code reviewers will make notes in your code for areas to improve or areas that need to be changed which is a huge help.  Lastly, the projects are a great time.  When working on the projects it is the coolest experience seeing yourself build entire websites that you would;ve never thought you would be able to do.  I believe that TripleTen has helped a huge amount with my goals of becoming a software engineer with these features.  They even offer career help where they guide you on how to build your LinkedIn and how to basically reach out for jobs and eventually how to take an interview to land those jobs.Some tips I would give to someone who is new and just starting their coding journey I would definitely make sure that it is something that you can see yourself doing.  For people that want to take this path I would definitely recommend the TripleTens software engineer course.  I have been very surprised with all that the bootcamp offers, especially at its cheap price.  Before purchasing the course I would first recommend that you talk to someone on the phone about the course to get a better understanding before fully committing to
