I started my coding journey in June of 2023 with no experience at all. Today, I am confidently building very intuitive, efficient, appealing and scalable full stack websites using React.js and Node.js for a backend. Having so much in depth learning of the theory as well as hands on coding have provided me skills I will carry with me forever. Heres a list of the pros and cons, as well as some advice! Pros: - The course offers help at anytime you need it. The barrier between students and tutors is non-existent. Its super easy to get help and there isn&#39;t any time frames besides obvious hours no one works! There are also office hours (And alot of them) in which allows you to actually speak with a tutor to get more in depth help if preferred. - The material is an amazing balance between theory, and coding. The knowledge the curriculum provides regarding theory makes it so much easier to pick up other tech stacks outside of what the bootcamp teaches. For example, I have given myself quite a bit of exposure to Java and Python and getting a grasp on these stacks has been much easier than it would be without experience and understanding of general theory and syntax. - The projects you create are very fun and appealing! Cons - The learning curve is quite large for one with no experience and the content can be alot to take in. With that, some advice I would give people wanting to partake in TripleTens bootcamp and have a structure and be ready for nonstop learning! If you are wanting to break into tech, I would highly recommend TripleTen! Amazing bootcamp, and amazing people.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Larissa Smith&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702152000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92655643?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Why did I choose TripleTen for my coding journey? I did some research and wanted a platform that stood out in the coding education crowd. As a graduate of another coding BootCamp, I can personally appreciateTripleTen&#39;s commitment to their curriculum and students, which exceeded my previous experience. TripleTen&#39;s program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum and career program was all about making sure I&#39;m set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn&#39;t just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it&#39;s a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren&#39;t just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry&#39;s demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It&#39;s a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.\n\nNow, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I&#39;ve graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen&#39;s program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn&#39;t have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn&#39;t take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.\n\nTripleTen&#39;s features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It&#39;s like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn&#39;t just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn&#39;t some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn&#39;t your typical classroom scene. Don&#39;t expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It&#39;s more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that&#39;s the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn&#39;t need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that&#39;s a plus. And it&#39;s all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  \n\nTripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn&#39;t blame TripleTen for that; I think it&#39;s just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don&#39;t have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!\n\nThankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.\n\nIf you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that&#39;s more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn&#39;t demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That&#39;s when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn&#39;t just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn&#39;t just about coding; it&#39;s about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you&#39;re not just learning; you&#39;re gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. \nAs of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I&#39;ve learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn&#39;t even need to take a loan, so I&#39;m graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you&#39;re on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you&#39;re in good hands. Good luck!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Joel Alicea&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702324800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hello there I hope this blesses whoever reads it!I decided to learn business analytics more than a year ago, and this is where my search began.  I&#39;ve always loved business and rapport-building customer service but didn&#39;t see how that could be applied to a technical field, well I am glad I found TripleTen. It has helped me understand how businesses use analytics to make decisions and how producing these results is a form of serving customers - I enjoy talking to people very much but also LOVE a challenge. My biggest fear was Excel (even got laid off from a job for not understanding it) and TripleTen helped break down these harder concepts into step-by-step walkthroughs while also still challenging you. Their program is also for the busy bees - whether you have kids, work full time, and or go to school, I found the curriculum manageable and the team super helpful whenever you needed assistance. I put in 20 hours of work every week, sometimes a bit less (depending on my week&#39;s schedule) but it&#39;s all about applying yourself to the process and trusting it. There are sometimes when things are going to get hard but if you reach out for help, they&#39;ll be able to assist you, especially during co-working hours. Unlike other boot camps I researched before joining TripleTen, the program is fully remote and super affordable and the value you get in return makes the investment worth it. My favorite part of the BootCamp was the end projects of each sprint. Although dreadful at first, once I reached out to the community and saw the previous interactions with tutors from other student discussions I was able to piece together each project, which ultimately led to a great portfolio. The program has much more to offer but these are the highlights that I found worth mentioning. I am currently completing my final project and I look forward to adding this to my portfolio as well.  Lastly, I&#39;ve learned that coding is not only for those with the technical expertise or background. I come from a retail background with a degree in psychology, I am planning to use what I learned in TripleTen to join a team that cares about what I am passionate about.

After reviewing a few different options, that were extremely code-heavy and costly, I found tripleten. The initial conversation I had with the guidance team was very promising and reassuring, so I took the leap and started the QA track. After finishing the course the assistance through the career acceleration program has been extremely helpful. Compared to the assistance you receive from college post-graduation, TripleTen works with you 1-on-1 to make sure your resume best reflects your skills and stands out from the rest. I&#39;ve recommended this to a few people already.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kolter Metz&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702584000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145237847?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This course is it! Rewarding, Challenging, Flexible, Affordable, &amp; Thorough. After years of wanting to break into the field of computer software, &amp; months of research TripleTen checked all my needed requirements. I needed an affordable option that prepared me for a future career as a Software Engineer &amp; open the doors into the industry. Between juggling work &amp; family needs time is valuable, the course allows you to work around &amp; with these schedules. I dedicate at the minimum of 15 hours a week, &amp; usually try for 20 - 25 hours to complete the theory &amp; projects. The course is very thorough, I am almost half way through as I write this &amp; HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; many other development tools are taught &amp; used with even more as I will progress. There is a community of students, alumni, tutors, &amp; career coaches that work together, encourage, &amp; support students with the course &amp; for future success. The tutors are extremely versed with the course &amp; provide the needed education beyond what the theory already covers &amp; have been available as I have needed at different times through out the day &amp; night. This program comes with career support assistance &amp; begins quite early on in the course preparing you for interviews &amp; networking to add to the knowledge you receive for the job you will actually want. This is a challenging course that helps actually learn &amp; not just provide the answers. After completing each project the knowledge gained is rewarding knowing how far you are from the beginning. I would advise anyone thinking about joining or a similar career path to do it, &amp; use everything the course &amp; community offers, I am glad I did.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheena Irvin&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702584000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;When I made the decision to do a career change, I compared about 10 different bootcamps based on factors such as: duration, guarantees, pricing, reviews, resources available like tutors, and the curriculum.

They’ve been really structured, engaged, supportive, and amazing so far. I have a full time job so it was important that the program allows self pace, and so far it’s been great. I study after work Mon-Fri, and 8 hrs on a sat or sun. My favorite features of the program: interactive tasks for theory practice with feedback, real practice on assigned projects, career acceleration program/guarantee, and the availability of tutoring sessions (I’m able to hop on at nights AND on weekends!).&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sveta Ko&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702584000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70713202?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I’ve been trying to learn coding for some time, mostly on my own. I explored various ‘Intro to IT’ marathons and a ton of free online courses. I learned here and there, on and off, over the course of 2 years.\nBy 2023, I started thinking about trying a bootcamp, especially after hearing numerous success stories from friends and YouTubers. There are tons of bootcamps, so picking one wasn&#39;t easy. I wanted one with good job support, real project work, and a decent price. That led me to Triple Ten. They had a deal with Women Who Code, so I got half off.\nSo far, I&#39;m halfway through the program. I like that they use unique studying materials and the whole process is divided into sprints, so it feels like a real job in IT. They&#39;ve got this system that checks our code automatically; however, the human touch isn&#39;t lost – real people also check every line of code. At first, getting feedback was hard, but now it&#39;s cool, and I&#39;m looking forward to every review. I can definitely tell my skills are growing, as well as my self-confidence. Moreover, the community is incredibly supportive. Tutors, coaches, and other students are ready to help in the Discord chat. I also like the coding sessions and office hours where we can talk about our projects and get help with coding problems. I especially like opportunities to collaborate with other students. In December 2023, we had Code Jam, where we worked with students from other programs. I&#39;m sure that my GitHub and LinkedIn will be full of cool projects that I will show to my future employer&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Arsenii Peskovatskov&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1702670400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Joining TripleTen&#39;s QA Engineering course marked a significant shift from my background in restaurant customer service to the tech industry.

TripleTen has both! It has a great community of students, graduates, and of course professional tutors that are active on a daily basis. Because the course is based on self learning, you can basically study anytime which is great for people who have hectic schedules like me. But they have the added benefit of zoom classes every weekend for students who need 1 on 1 training on specifics.My favorite feature is in the way that the actual learning material is structured. For every concept, TripleTen has an interactive notebook that you can instantly apply learned concepts on through practice which is great because it adds an additional layer of information retention quickly.

Having so much in depth learning of the theory as well as hands on coding have provided me skills I will carry with me forever. Heres a list of the pros and cons, as well as some advice! Pros: - The course offers help at anytime you need it. The barrier between students and tutors is non-existent. Its super easy to get help and there isn&#39;t any time frames besides obvious hours no one works! There are also office hours (And alot of them) in which allows you to actually speak with a tutor to get more in depth help if preferred. - The material is an amazing balance between theory, and coding. The knowledge the curriculum provides regarding theory makes it so much easier to pick up other tech stacks outside of what the bootcamp teaches. For example, I have given myself quite a bit of exposure to Java and Python and getting a grasp on these stacks has been much easier than it would be without experience and understanding of general theory and syntax. - The projects you create are very fun and appealing! Cons - The learning curve is quite large for one with no experience and the content can be alot to take in. With that, some advice I would give people wanting to partake in TripleTens bootcamp and have a structure and be ready for nonstop learning! If you are wanting to break into tech, I would highly recommend TripleTen!

TripleTen&#39;s program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum and career program was all about making sure I&#39;m set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn&#39;t just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it&#39;s a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren&#39;t just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry&#39;s demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It&#39;s a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.

Now, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I&#39;ve graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen&#39;s program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn&#39;t have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn&#39;t take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.

TripleTen&#39;s features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It&#39;s like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn&#39;t just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn&#39;t some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn&#39;t your typical classroom scene. Don&#39;t expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It&#39;s more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that&#39;s the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn&#39;t need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that&#39;s a plus. And it&#39;s all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  

TripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn&#39;t blame TripleTen for that; I think it&#39;s just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don&#39;t have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!

Thankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.

If you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that&#39;s more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn&#39;t demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That&#39;s when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn&#39;t just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn&#39;t just about coding; it&#39;s about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you&#39;re not just learning; you&#39;re gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. 
As of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I&#39;ve learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn&#39;t even need to take a loan, so I&#39;m graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you&#39;re on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you&#39;re in good hands. Good luck! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><!----><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Joel Alicea</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Hello there I hope this blesses whoever reads it!I decided to learn business analytics more than a year ago, and this is where my search began.  I&#39;ve always loved business and rapport-building customer service but didn&#39;t see how that could be applied to a technical field, well I am glad I found Trip... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>leTen. It has helped me understand how businesses use analytics to make decisions and how producing these results is a form of serving customers - I enjoy talking to people very much but also LOVE a challenge. My biggest fear was Excel (even got laid off from a job for not understanding it) and TripleTen helped break down these harder concepts into step-by-step walkthroughs while also still challenging you. Their program is also for the busy bees - whether you have kids, work full time, and or go to school, I found the curriculum manageable and the team super helpful whenever you needed assistance. I put in 20 hours of work every week, sometimes a bit less (depending on my week&#39;s schedule) but it&#39;s all about applying yourself to the process and trusting it. There are sometimes when things are going to get hard but if you reach out for help, they&#39;ll be able to assist you, especially during co-working hours. Unlike other boot camps I researched before joining TripleTen, the program is fully remote and super affordable and the value you get in return makes the investment worth it. My favorite part of the BootCamp was the end projects of each sprint. Although dreadful at first, once I reached out to the community and saw the previous interactions with tutors from other student discussions I was able to piece together each project, which ultimately led to a great portfolio. The program has much more to offer but these are the highlights that I found worth mentioning. I am currently completing my final project and I look forward to adding this to my portfolio as well.  Lastly, I&#39;ve learned that coding is not only for those with the technical expertise or background. I come from a retail background with a degree in psychology, I am planning to use what I learned in TripleTen to join a team that cares about what I am passionate about. If you love business and you&#39;re curious, I&#39;ll recommend giving TripleTen a shot, and if you&#39;re stuck on the fence about whether to dive into data analytics regardless - please do it. Your future self would thank you! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><!----><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kyle Kolodziej</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose the QA Engineering track as a way to bolster my current experience within QA work, and to get more relevant knowledge and experience with coding/software QA work.

The course is very thorough, I am almost half way through as I write this &amp; HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; many other development tools are taught &amp; used with even more as I will progress.

There are tons of bootcamps, so picking one wasn&#39;t easy. I wanted one with good job support, real project work, and a decent price. That led me to Triple Ten. They had a deal with Women Who Code, so I got half off.
So far, I&#39;m halfway through the program. I like that they use unique studying materials and the whole process is divided into sprints, so it feels like a real job in IT. They&#39;ve got this system that checks our code automatically; however, the human touch isn&#39;t lost – real people also check every line of code. At first, getting feedback was hard, but now it&#39;s cool, and I&#39;m looking forward to every review. I can definitely tell my skills are growing, as well as my self-confidence. Moreover, the community is incredibly supportive. Tutors, coaches, and other students are ready to help in the Discord chat. I also like the coding sessions and office hours where we can talk about our projects and get help with coding problems. I especially like opportunities to collaborate with other students. In December 2023, we had Code Jam, where we worked with students from other programs.

But they have the added benefit of zoom classes every weekend for students who need 1 on 1 training on specifics.My favorite feature is in the way that the actual learning material is structured. For every concept, TripleTen has an interactive notebook that you can instantly apply learned concepts on through practice which is great because it adds an additional layer of information retention quickly.

I started my coding journey in June of 2023 with no experience at all. Today, I am confidently building very intuitive, efficient, appealing and scalable full stack websites using React.js and Node.js for a backend. Having so much in depth learning of the theory as well as hands on coding have provided me skills I will carry with me forever. Heres a list of the pros and cons, as well as some advice! Pros: - The course offers help at anytime you need it. The barrier between students and tutors is non-existent. Its super easy to get help and there isn't any time frames besides obvious hours no one works! There are also office hours (And alot of them) in which allows you to actually speak with a tutor to get more in depth help if preferred. - The material is an amazing balance between theory, and coding. The knowledge the curriculum provides regarding theory makes it so much easier to pick up other tech stacks outside of what the bootcamp teaches. For example, I have given myself quite a bit of exposure to Java and Python and getting a grasp on these stacks has been much easier than it would be without experience and understanding of general theory and syntax. - The projects you create are very fun and appealing! Cons - The learning curve is quite large for one with no experience and the content can be alot to take in. With that, some advice I would give people wanting to partake in TripleTens bootcamp and have a structure and be ready for nonstop learning! If you are wanting to break into tech, I would highly recommend TripleTen! Amazing bootcamp, and amazing people.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dillon Arnold"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Why did I choose TripleTen for my coding journey? I did some research and wanted a platform that stood out in the coding education crowd. As a graduate of another coding BootCamp, I can personally appreciateTripleTen's commitment to their curriculum and students, which exceeded my previous experience. TripleTen's program was thorough, affordable and flexible.  In contrast to my previous BootCamp experience, TripleTen's curriculum and career program was all about making sure I'm set for success. The promise of landing a job within six months of graduation or your money back is a huge plus, and not something a lot of boot camps offer.When it comes to education, TripleTen doesn't just stand out in terms of flexibility and support; it's a game-changer in affordability and content quality. The courses dive deep into the intricacies of QA Engineering, ensuring that graduates aren't just equipped with the basics but emerge as knowledgeable professionals ready for the industry's demands. TripleTen has cracked the code, providing a top-notch education without breaking the bank. It's a testament to their commitment to making quality coding education accessible to all.\n\nNow, some detailed information about my journey at TripleTen. I started with the Front-End program earlier this year, I believe it was around April. Like I mentioned, I've graduated from another BootCamp last year, and that one was also Front-End. TripleTen compared to the other BootCamp (which shall not be named haha) was amazing. I have some knowledge about programming, so when I started TripleTen's program I was impressed by the quality and detailed information, some of which was new, even in the first project. It was a challenging curriculum, but of very high quality. I decided a few weeks into that program that I wanted to make the switch into tech asap (I hated my customer service job and wanted out), so I switched to QA - which is basically testing the software instead of being the one writing it.TripleTen accommodated me seamlessly. There was no big deal; I didn't have to pay even more money to switch, and it didn't take a lot of time either. Coming from the Front-End program, I knew that QA would be a shorter program; however, TripleTen clearly put the same amount of detail and dedication into the curriculum to ensure I was set up for success, no matter which program I chose.\n\nTripleTen's features are pretty straightforward, which made it easy to just focus on learning. It's like a user-friendly tour guide for coding. The interactive learning platform doesn't just throw theory at you; it lets you play with it. This is important because coding isn't some kind of theory; you need to be actually coding to learn how to code.With that in mind, learning with TripleTen isn't your typical classroom scene. Don't expect someone standing at the front of the class and a room full of people taking notes. It's more like a straightforward dive into the curriculum, interactive platform, hands-on exercises, and projects – less like a lecture, more like a coding adventure. And that's the best way to learn to code. Not watching tutorials, but actually working in an IDE (like VSCode) to start coding yourself. For many of the lessons, TripleTen had a built-in IDE, so I didn't need to leave the platform, which was easy and convenient. Also, the built-in IDE was pretty good, so that's a plus. And it's all online, so you can complete the theory and projects without leaving home.  \n\nTripleTen also has a discord community. The Front-End program and the QA program each have their own, and I'm sure it's like that for each program. To be honest, the Front-End discord had way more going on, and the QA chat was quiet in comparison. But I wouldn't blame TripleTen for that; I think it's just a reflection of where the students are going, to Front-End instead of QA, so keep that in mind if you desire a large, active community discord. However, there are videos where the reviewers explain how to do some parts of the project, which was great because sometimes going from theory to the project can feel daunting. But, with the video reviews and the tutors who are available pretty much all day every day (they have a calendar you can check), you don't have to worry about the project being too difficult, although, expect it to make you think!\n\nThankfully, balancing a full-time job alongside the boot camp journey with TripleTen turned out to be surprisingly manageable, thanks to the flexibility of the program. The coursework, designed to fit into the nooks and crannies of a busy schedule, allowed me to seamlessly integrate learning into my daily routine. What made the journey even smoother was the constant encouragement and support from my success manager. Their motivation and regular check-ins became a driving force, turning potential challenges into achievable milestones. The combination of a flexible program and a supportive mentor made the balancing act not just doable but a genuinely enriching experience. As I navigated the intricacies of coding and the demands of a full-time job, the journey felt less like a tightrope walk and more like a guided marathon toward success.\n\nIf you find yourself in the shoes I once wore, discontent with a job that's more of a daily grind than a passion, TripleTen might just be your next step. I was stuck in a job I loathed, looking for a way out that wouldn't demand at least 4 years of education and the hefty price tag. That's when I stumbled upon TripleTen. It wasn't just another boot camp; it was a ticket to a career shift without the prolonged academic timeline. The unique flexibility and hands-on approach make learning practical and applicable, a refreshing departure from traditional education. TripleTen isn't just about coding; it's about unlocking a door to a realm of opportunities. The supportive community, real-world projects, and career guidance ensure you're not just learning; you're gearing up for success in the real-world tech landscape. \nAs of this review, I have one last project left in the QA program, and I've learned so much in a relatively short amount of time. Also, the price was affordable; I didn't even need to take a loan, so I'm graduating debt-free, which is basically impossible for any traditional educational program. Everyone I came into contact with at TripleTen was on my side and knowledgeable. If I could go back and choose TripleTen instead of wasting my time and money at the other BootCamp, I would. The career program is sure to be a game-changer and the 6-month job or money back guarantee is one less thing to worry about. If you're on the fence, I say take the leap. The time will pass anyway, and with the money-back guarantee, you're in good hands. Good luck!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Larissa Smith"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Hello there I hope this blesses whoever reads it!I decided to learn business analytics more than a year ago, and this is where my search began.  I've always loved business and rapport-building customer service but didn't see how that could be applied to a technical field, well I am glad I found TripleTen. It has helped me understand how businesses use analytics to make decisions and how producing these results is a form of serving customers - I enjoy talking to people very much but also LOVE a challenge. My biggest fear was Excel (even got laid off from a job for not understanding it) and TripleTen helped break down these harder concepts into step-by-step walkthroughs while also still challenging you. Their program is also for the busy bees - whether you have kids, work full time, and or go to school, I found the curriculum manageable and the team super helpful whenever you needed assistance. I put in 20 hours of work every week, sometimes a bit less (depending on my week's schedule) but it's all about applying yourself to the process and trusting it. There are sometimes when things are going to get hard but if you reach out for help, they'll be able to assist you, especially during co-working hours. Unlike other boot camps I researched before joining TripleTen, the program is fully remote and super affordable and the value you get in return makes the investment worth it. My favorite part of the BootCamp was the end projects of each sprint. Although dreadful at first, once I reached out to the community and saw the previous interactions with tutors from other student discussions I was able to piece together each project, which ultimately led to a great portfolio. The program has much more to offer but these are the highlights that I found worth mentioning. I am currently completing my final project and I look forward to adding this to my portfolio as well.  Lastly, I've learned that coding is not only for those with the technical expertise or background. I come from a retail background with a degree in psychology, I am planning to use what I learned in TripleTen to join a team that cares about what I am passionate about. If you love business and you're curious, I'll recommend giving TripleTen a shot, and if you're stuck on the fence about whether to dive into data analytics regardless - please do it.

There is a community of students, alumni, tutors, & career coaches that work together, encourage, & support students with the course & for future success. The tutors are extremely versed with the course & provide the needed education beyond what the theory already covers & have been available as I have needed at different times through out the day & night. This program comes with career support assistance & begins quite early on in the course preparing you for interviews & networking to add to the knowledge you receive for the job you will actually want. This is a challenging course that helps actually learn & not just provide the answers. After completing each project the knowledge gained is rewarding knowing how far you are from the beginning. I would advise anyone thinking about joining or a similar career path to do it, & use everything the course & community offers, I am glad I did.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kolter Metz"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"When I made the decision to do a career change, I compared about 10 different bootcamps based on factors such as: duration, guarantees, pricing, reviews, resources available like tutors, and the curriculum. TripleTen (back then practicum) had high scores on all these, so went with them. They’ve been really structured, engaged, supportive, and amazing so far. I have a full time job so it was important that the program allows self pace, and so far it’s been great. I study after work Mon-Fri, and 8 hrs on a sat or sun. My favorite features of the program: interactive tasks for theory practice with feedback, real practice on assigned projects, career acceleration program/guarantee, and the availability of tutoring sessions (I’m able to hop on at nights AND on weekends!).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sheena Irvin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I’ve been trying to learn coding for some time, mostly on my own. I explored various ‘Intro to IT’ marathons and a ton of free online courses. I learned here and there, on and off, over the course of 2 years.\nBy 2023, I started thinking about trying a bootcamp, especially after hearing numerous success stories from friends and YouTubers. There are tons of bootcamps, so picking one wasn't easy. I wanted one with good job support, real project work, and a decent price. That led me to Triple Ten. They had a deal with Women Who Code, so I got half off.\nSo far, I'm halfway through the program. I like that they use unique studying materials and the whole process is divided into sprints, so it feels like a real job in IT. They've got this system that checks our code automatically; however, the human touch isn't lost – real people also check every line of code. At first, getting feedback was hard, but now it's cool, and I'm looking forward to every review. I can definitely tell my skills are growing, as well as my self-confidence. Moreover, the community is incredibly supportive. Tutors, coaches, and other students are ready to help in the Discord chat. I also like the coding sessions and office hours where we can talk about our projects and get help with coding problems. I especially like opportunities to collaborate with other students. In December 2023, we had Code Jam, where we worked with students from other programs. I'm sure that my GitHub and LinkedIn will be full of cool projects that I will show to my future employer","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sveta Ko"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-15T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Joining TripleTen's QA Engineering course marked a significant shift from my background in restaurant customer service to the tech industry. It was a decision that brought a unique set of challenges and opportunities.\n\nBalancing the course with full-time work required a disciplined approach, dedicating evenings and weekends to study. This wasn’t just about learning new concepts; it was an immersive experience that demanded both commitment and passion.\n\nWhat stood out for me at TripleTen were the practical projects. These weren't mere academic exercises but rather real-world simulations that honed my problem-solving skills. Tackling these projects provided not only a deep understanding of QA principles but also a tangible sense of achievement.\n\nThe community aspect of TripleTen was particularly valuable. Interaction with peers and mentors created a supportive learning environment, essential for navigating complex topics. Tools like ChatGPT supplemented this support, offering additional assistance when needed.\n\nA significant part of my journey involved maintaining an active LinkedIn profile, a strategy that proved crucial in my job search. Regularly updating my profile with projects and skills gained through the course enhanced my visibility and connectivity in the tech industry.\n\nOverall, TripleTen provided a comprehensive platform for transitioning into the tech world. It offered a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, set within a supportive community. For those considering a career shift into tech, TripleTen offers a solid foundation to build upon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Arsenii Peskovatskov"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-15T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I recently completed the data science course on TripleTen and would like to share my experience. My 2 hard requirements when finding a coding bootcamp were that the bootcamp have an active community with support and that it offers a flexible schedule due to my life circumstances. TripleTen has both! It has a great community of students, graduates, and of course professional tutors that are active on a daily basis. Because the course is based on self learning, you can basically study anytime which is great for people who have hectic schedules like me. But they have the added benefit of zoom classes every weekend for students who need 1 on 1 training on specifics.My favorite feature is in the way that the actual learning material is structured. For every concept, TripleTen has an interactive notebook that you can instantly apply learned concepts on through practice which is great because it adds an additional layer of information retention quickly. I really am not a fan of lecture based learning so this was perfect for me. I would definitely highly recommend this course to anyone who is in search of a comprehensive datascience course with a great community and active support staff.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hugo Tomita"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
