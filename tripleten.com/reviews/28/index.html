After some research, I found TripleTen&#39;s programs and made an appointment with an Admissions Counselor to discuss my interest. As they say, the rest is history. I knew that starting this bootcamp would challenge me in so many ways. I have no background or prior education specifically in technology, so I had to learn many things from the ground up. I also needed to learn how to become a student again as a parent with full-time employment. As I began my first Sprint, I was immediately surprised and impressed with the interactive platform TripleTen has to learn the material and complete special projects. The information is presented in a logical way, and offers ways to check your knowledge at various points. As I progressed through my learning experience, I did face a number of challenges as I struggled with some of the material. The support I received from my Success Manager, the various chat groups, and help from tutoring sessions was outstanding! With all the grace and guidance extended to me, I was able to push my way through - what a rewarding achievement to overcome obstacles!Thank you, TripleTen, for offering a program designed to suit all levels of experience and backgrounds allowing students to grow personally and professionally!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric T&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716062400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65f3042676352300127c816b/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I joined TripleTen so I could start working remotely and provide a better lifestyle for my family. The DS program has been fun, challenging, and useful. I am about 2/3&#39;s done. I like the structure of the program. As long as I put the time, I continue to move the ball down the field. After I submit my projects I always appreciate the feedback I get. It really helps refine my skills. I plan to finish TripleTen ahead of schedule. I&#39;ve kept a solid pace with the learning and projects and have been able to get 2 weeks ahead, which is nice to have a buffer so I don&#39;t have to be concerned if I need to a week off for family or travel. I&#39;m looking forward to finishing soon, it does go by fast, and starting my career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Gerardo Torres&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716062400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69262#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was looking for a change from Law Enforcement, but that could provide flexible hours and time for my work schedule. I came across TripleTen, they provided the best option to help me break into tech as well work with my work schedule. I choose to enroll in the QA Engineering program mainly because I like to find problems and provide a solution, as well be apart of a project that can be beneficial. I spent about 15-20 hours a week on the study materials as well as the projects. During my time at TripleTen I was meet with positive support and knowledge from everyone from my Success Manager to the Tutors all were very accommodating and helpful but most of all supportive during the process of completing my certification. The vas amount of knowledge the instructors have is very impressive and applicable to real life situations. The projects replicated real life projects that i would have to handle on a day to day bases and they range from having no knowledge at all on what QA is to prepping you to be advance in QA  I am proud to be a Graduate of TripleTen QA Engineering Program, and have told many of my co-workers as well friends&#39; about the smooth and extensiveness of the program, and how much I had fun learning all the up to date information.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alberto Romero&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716235200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69309#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to join TripleTen Bootcamp after I concluded that I wanted to change my career path. I did my research on other bootcamps and made my decision on which one to join based on a few factors. The two biggest reasons I joined TripleTen was because it included job assistance and money back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job within 6 months after completing the course. Other factors that helped me make my decision were the fact that it had a good curriculum and the bootcamp was relatively affordable. Before starting TripleTen, I was a bit nervous due to the fact that I had no experience in the tech industry. My background is in Barbering, so it was a completely different field. I had doubts if I could even finish the program, but after starting I soon realized that the bootcamp is tailored for beginners like me! The lessons walk you step by step making sure you learn everything you need to know. There is some points in the program where it gets frustrating because you are receiving a ton of information at once. The good thing though, is that they use a platform for communication called Discord where you can ask tutors or fellow students for help. Like I mentioned before, they help you get a job after you&#39;ve completed the program. Although I am not at that stage yet, I am excited for it. What I have done though, is I participated in a \&quot;Bug Jam\&quot; where we worked in teams to finished a project in a short amount of time. I thought it was amazing that TripleTen offered something like this because it provides some type of \&quot;real life\&quot; experience.Overall, Tripleten is a great bootcamp. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is trying to get into tech!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Nicoleta Craciun&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716321600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69314#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Having participated in multiple bootcamps, TripleTen QA Bootcamp is by far the best.

This course presented itself as a pivotal opportunity to build the life I aspire to, providing me with the means to secure a fulfilling and inspiring career, where I can grow both professionally and personally. Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that enrolling in the Tripleten course is one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made for my future.As I approach the completion of Sprint 8, I find myself filled with a mix of excitement and a touch of sadness, knowing that the end of this incredible journey is near. Each sprint has been meticulously designed, offering a wealth of information and resources that are both comprehensive and well-organized. The clarity and structure of the course content have greatly facilitated my learning process, ensuring that I can absorb and apply new concepts effectively.The support network provided by Tripleten is truly exceptional. From Success Managers and tutors to senior students and my study buddies, the level of assistance available has been outstanding. The Discord community, in particular, has been a valuable resource. Tutors are readily available to provide guidance and address any issues or problems that arise while learning or working on projects. This constant support has been instrumental in maintaining my motivation and ensuring my progress throughout the course.The projects themselves are a highlight of the Tripleten experience. They are not only engaging and thought-provoking but also designed to challenge us and stimulate our creativity. Working on these projects has been incredibly rewarding, as they mirror real-world scenarios and prepare us for the demands of our future careers. The sense of accomplishment I feel upon completing each project is a testament to the course&#39;s effectiveness in equipping us with practical skills and knowledge.Furthermore, the course fosters a sense of community and collaboration among students. The interactive elements, such as group discussions and collaborative projects, have helped me build meaningful connections with my peers. These relationships have enriched my learning experience and provided me with a support system that extends beyond the confines of the course.In conclusion, the Tripleten course has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It has been a transformative experience that has not only equipped me with the technical skills needed for a successful career but also fostered my personal growth. As I look forward to the final stages of the course, I am confident that I am well-prepared to embark on a fulfilling and inspiring career. I wholeheartedly recommend the Tripleten course to anyone seeking to make a significant positive change in their life and achieve their professional and personal goals.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Amanda Davis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716408000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69344#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ll be honest, I wanted to start coding for the money. I&#39;ve been in about two bootcamps (at separate times) when I started my coding journey and TripleTen by far has been the best. They give you everything you need to succeed. A notable thing about TripleTen is that they know people have lives outside of school. Most of the people that join Bootcamps either have a different career, or have a job of some type, and have full lives, so they do give you goal dates but they are not set in stone; you can always ask for more time. You can also ask for a payment plan so you don&#39;t have to dump your savings all up front and if you refer someone, then you can get a cut from your payment too!  Aside from that, the courses are really straightforward and they always are asking for suggestions to improve them. The tutors are nice and are always available to help and they even have live sessions that you can drop into to get more help. Another one of the best parts is that they have career courses once you get past a certain point. It really got my motivation up to edit my LinkedIn and start networking. I like the fact that they have externships to get you going in the workforce too. They said they were volunteer based which I&#39;m definitely fine with because it would be the same as doing a project in the course but this time, you get real world experience to add to your portfolio. They also start the courses for very beginners but it never hurts to look online first to at least see if you like what you&#39;ll be taking the courses for (also if you&#39;re having a little trouble too). I&#39;m finishing my QA course pretty quickly and only spend about 3-4 hours a day on it (I got a bit of time on my hands, but it leaves my weekends free) but after I get a good job doing that, I&#39;ll probably take another course TripleTen has to offer to build up my resume more. I kinda hope I can be a tutor for the QA course in TripleTen so if you&#39;re thinking about joining, and remember this review, feel free to say hi!

Prior to coming to TripleTen I researched different tech roles and bootcamps and came across TripleTen after doing yet another tech quiz that pointed me in the direct of QA Engineering. I did not know much about this role, but I wanted to try it out. I took the introductory course and was hooked. After completing the introductory project, I reached out to participate in the complete bootcamp. I was happy to hear they offer job assistance and had a high success rate in hirers prior to and post-graduation of the course. I also appreciated the flexibility of the course. I am very thankful to the team member I spoke with to help me get set up with TripleTen. She made everything a breeze and notified me of all my options. Since I have been in this course, I have learned so much. What I love the most about this course is that it is always improving to be better and incorporating new and helpful tools, just like tech. I have not yet completed this course, but I have made great connections and am being provided with the tools and knowledge that I need to succeed. I am looking forward to my future as a QA Engineer.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Leeanne Duval&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1716926400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69482#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently looking to change careers and TripleTen was one of the top bootcamps during my research. I took the quiz on their site, researched a bit about the program, spoke to a few current students and alumni of the program and everyone had good things to say about the program, so I signed up. The initial call was very helpful, and the representative answered all of my questions. So, any reservations I had up to that point went away. TripleTen offers a lot of help to their students with a plethora of tips and tricks for your job search as well. \nI’ve been taking the actual QA courses for around two months now and it is challenging but so far very worth it. From day one the content has been engaging and provides interesting topics. I’m not a fan of coding and there is some involved in this program, but I am getting through it and the tutors are always there to provide help and support. The program is self-paced so I’m hoping to graduate early. There are weekly career talks and tutoring sessions as well. They also have a schedule you can follow along with your class and have an interactive learning session for each topic. The community and success team are very helpful. \nSo far, I would recommend this program.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Julieth Sepulveda&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717012800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69562#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m incredibly happy with my experience at TripleTen. They accepted me without much prior experience and guided me to become a QA engineer. Not only did they teach me all the program basics, but their emotional support was truly remarkable. They walked with me through every step of my journey, ensuring I had all the necessary skills to ace my job interviews. This school is exceptionally organized and genuinely cares about students who are eager to learn. They offer a fantastic platform with a variety of hands-on projects that provide extensive experience. The supportive Discord community, along with dedicated tutors, successful managers, and Dot the AI, made learning a collaborative effort. Additionally, the career coach and other features make TripleTen unique and absolutely worth trying. I highly recommend TripleTen for anyone looking to break into the tech industry with comprehensive support and hands-on learning opportunities.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Christopher Byrne</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>My journey with TripleTen began after discovering and reading the job description of a Quality Assurance Engineer while sitting in train station in New York.

As I began my first Sprint, I was immediately surprised and impressed with the interactive platform TripleTen has to learn the material and complete special projects. The information is presented in a logical way, and offers ways to check your knowledge at various points. As I progressed through my learning experience, I did face a number of challenges as I struggled with some of the material. The support I received from my Success Manager, the various chat groups, and help from tutoring sessions was outstanding!

Other factors that helped me make my decision were the fact that it had a good curriculum and the bootcamp was relatively affordable. Before starting TripleTen, I was a bit nervous due to the fact that I had no experience in the tech industry. My background is in Barbering, so it was a completely different field. I had doubts if I could even finish the program, but after starting I soon realized that the bootcamp is tailored for beginners like me! The lessons walk you step by step making sure you learn everything you need to know. There is some points in the program where it gets frustrating because you are receiving a ton of information at once. The good thing though, is that they use a platform for communication called Discord where you can ask tutors or fellow students for help. Like I mentioned before, they help you get a job after you&#39;ve completed the program. Although I am not at that stage yet, I am excited for it. What I have done though, is I participated in a &quot;Bug Jam&quot; where we worked in teams to finished a project in a short amount of time. I thought it was amazing that TripleTen offered something like this because it provides some type of &quot;real life&quot; experience.Overall, Tripleten is a great bootcamp.

Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that enrolling in the Tripleten course is one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made for my future.As I approach the completion of Sprint 8, I find myself filled with a mix of excitement and a touch of sadness, knowing that the end of this incredible journey is near. Each sprint has been meticulously designed, offering a wealth of information and resources that are both comprehensive and well-organized. The clarity and structure of the course content have greatly facilitated my learning process, ensuring that I can absorb and apply new concepts effectively.The support network provided by Tripleten is truly exceptional. From Success Managers and tutors to senior students and my study buddies, the level of assistance available has been outstanding. The Discord community, in particular, has been a valuable resource. Tutors are readily available to provide guidance and address any issues or problems that arise while learning or working on projects. This constant support has been instrumental in maintaining my motivation and ensuring my progress throughout the course.The projects themselves are a highlight of the Tripleten experience. They are not only engaging and thought-provoking but also designed to challenge us and stimulate our creativity. Working on these projects has been incredibly rewarding, as they mirror real-world scenarios and prepare us for the demands of our future careers. The sense of accomplishment I feel upon completing each project is a testament to the course&#39;s effectiveness in equipping us with practical skills and knowledge.Furthermore, the course fosters a sense of community and collaboration among students. The interactive elements, such as group discussions and collaborative projects, have helped me build meaningful connections with my peers. These relationships have enriched my learning experience and provided me with a support system that extends beyond the confines of the course.In conclusion, the Tripleten course has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It has been a transformative experience that has not only equipped me with the technical skills needed for a successful career but also fostered my personal growth. As I look forward to the final stages of the course, I am confident that I am well-prepared to embark on a fulfilling and inspiring career. I wholeheartedly recommend the Tripleten course to anyone seeking to make a significant positive change in their life and achieve their professional and personal goals. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69325#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Amanda Davis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ll be honest, I wanted to start coding for the money. I&#39;ve been in about two bootcamps (at separate times) when I started my coding journey and TripleTen by far has been the best. They give you everything you need to succeed. A notable thing about TripleTen is that they know people have lives outs... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ide of school. Most of the people that join Bootcamps either have a different career, or have a job of some type, and have full lives, so they do give you goal dates but they are not set in stone; you can always ask for more time. You can also ask for a payment plan so you don&#39;t have to dump your savings all up front and if you refer someone, then you can get a cut from your payment too!  Aside from that, the courses are really straightforward and they always are asking for suggestions to improve them. The tutors are nice and are always available to help and they even have live sessions that you can drop into to get more help. Another one of the best parts is that they have career courses once you get past a certain point. It really got my motivation up to edit my LinkedIn and start networking. I like the fact that they have externships to get you going in the workforce too. They said they were volunteer based which I&#39;m definitely fine with because it would be the same as doing a project in the course but this time, you get real world experience to add to your portfolio. They also start the courses for very beginners but it never hurts to look online first to at least see if you like what you&#39;ll be taking the courses for (also if you&#39;re having a little trouble too). I&#39;m finishing my QA course pretty quickly and only spend about 3-4 hours a day on it (I got a bit of time on my hands, but it leaves my weekends free) but after I get a good job doing that, I&#39;ll probably take another course TripleTen has to offer to build up my resume more. I kinda hope I can be a tutor for the QA course in TripleTen so if you&#39;re thinking about joining, and remember this review, feel free to say hi!

I’ve been taking the actual QA courses for around two months now and it is challenging but so far very worth it. From day one the content has been engaging and provides interesting topics. I’m not a fan of coding and there is some involved in this program, but I am getting through it and the tutors are always there to provide help and support. The program is self-paced so I’m hoping to graduate early. There are weekly career talks and tutoring sessions as well. They also have a schedule you can follow along with your class and have an interactive learning session for each topic. The community and success team are very helpful.

After some research, I found TripleTen's programs and made an appointment with an Admissions Counselor to discuss my interest. As they say, the rest is history. I knew that starting this bootcamp would challenge me in so many ways. I have no background or prior education specifically in technology, so I had to learn many things from the ground up. I also needed to learn how to become a student again as a parent with full-time employment. As I began my first Sprint, I was immediately surprised and impressed with the interactive platform TripleTen has to learn the material and complete special projects. The information is presented in a logical way, and offers ways to check your knowledge at various points. As I progressed through my learning experience, I did face a number of challenges as I struggled with some of the material. The support I received from my Success Manager, the various chat groups, and help from tutoring sessions was outstanding! With all the grace and guidance extended to me, I was able to push my way through - what a rewarding achievement to overcome obstacles!Thank you, TripleTen, for offering a program designed to suit all levels of experience and backgrounds allowing students to grow personally and professionally!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Byrne"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-18T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I joined TripleTen so I could start working remotely and provide a better lifestyle for my family.

I came across TripleTen, they provided the best option to help me break into tech as well work with my work schedule. I choose to enroll in the QA Engineering program mainly because I like to find problems and provide a solution, as well be apart of a project that can be beneficial. I spent about 15-20 hours a week on the study materials as well as the projects. During my time at TripleTen I was meet with positive support and knowledge from everyone from my Success Manager to the Tutors all were very accommodating and helpful but most of all supportive during the process of completing my certification. The vas amount of knowledge the instructors have is very impressive and applicable to real life situations.

I did my research on other bootcamps and made my decision on which one to join based on a few factors. The two biggest reasons I joined TripleTen was because it included job assistance and money back guarantee if you don't get a job within 6 months after completing the course. Other factors that helped me make my decision were the fact that it had a good curriculum and the bootcamp was relatively affordable. Before starting TripleTen, I was a bit nervous due to the fact that I had no experience in the tech industry. My background is in Barbering, so it was a completely different field. I had doubts if I could even finish the program, but after starting I soon realized that the bootcamp is tailored for beginners like me! The lessons walk you step by step making sure you learn everything you need to know. There is some points in the program where it gets frustrating because you are receiving a ton of information at once. The good thing though, is that they use a platform for communication called Discord where you can ask tutors or fellow students for help. Like I mentioned before, they help you get a job after you've completed the program. Although I am not at that stage yet, I am excited for it. What I have done though, is I participated in a \"Bug Jam\" where we worked in teams to finished a project in a short amount of time. I thought it was amazing that TripleTen offered something like this because it provides some type of \"real life\" experience.Overall, Tripleten is a great bootcamp. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is trying to get into tech!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alberto Romero"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-21T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Having participated in multiple bootcamps, TripleTen QA Bootcamp is by far the best.

Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that enrolling in the Tripleten course is one of the best decisions I've made for my future.As I approach the completion of Sprint 8, I find myself filled with a mix of excitement and a touch of sadness, knowing that the end of this incredible journey is near. Each sprint has been meticulously designed, offering a wealth of information and resources that are both comprehensive and well-organized. The clarity and structure of the course content have greatly facilitated my learning process, ensuring that I can absorb and apply new concepts effectively.The support network provided by Tripleten is truly exceptional. From Success Managers and tutors to senior students and my study buddies, the level of assistance available has been outstanding. The Discord community, in particular, has been a valuable resource. Tutors are readily available to provide guidance and address any issues or problems that arise while learning or working on projects. This constant support has been instrumental in maintaining my motivation and ensuring my progress throughout the course.The projects themselves are a highlight of the Tripleten experience. They are not only engaging and thought-provoking but also designed to challenge us and stimulate our creativity.

I've been in about two bootcamps (at separate times) when I started my coding journey and TripleTen by far has been the best. They give you everything you need to succeed. A notable thing about TripleTen is that they know people have lives outside of school. Most of the people that join Bootcamps either have a different career, or have a job of some type, and have full lives, so they do give you goal dates but they are not set in stone; you can always ask for more time. You can also ask for a payment plan so you don't have to dump your savings all up front and if you refer someone, then you can get a cut from your payment too!  Aside from that, the courses are really straightforward and they always are asking for suggestions to improve them. The tutors are nice and are always available to help and they even have live sessions that you can drop into to get more help. Another one of the best parts is that they have career courses once you get past a certain point. It really got my motivation up to edit my LinkedIn and start networking. I like the fact that they have externships to get you going in the workforce too. They said they were volunteer based which I'm definitely fine with because it would be the same as doing a project in the course but this time, you get real world experience to add to your portfolio. They also start the courses for very beginners but it never hurts to look online first to at least see if you like what you'll be taking the courses for (also if you're having a little trouble too). I'm finishing my QA course pretty quickly and only spend about 3-4 hours a day on it (I got a bit of time on my hands, but it leaves my weekends free) but after I get a good job doing that, I'll probably take another course TripleTen has to offer to build up my resume more. I kinda hope I can be a tutor for the QA course in TripleTen so if you're thinking about joining, and remember this review, feel free to say hi!
