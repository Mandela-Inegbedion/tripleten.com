From the start, it was evident that TripleTen was the perfect fit for someone like me, seeking a path into tech with a broader skill set. What truly stands out about TripleTen is its recognition that success in the tech world extends beyond coding alone. As someone not particularly fond of extensive coding, the program&#39;s focus on areas like BI Analytics provided a refreshing alternative. The curriculum was meticulously crafted, offering a comprehensive understanding of data analysis without the overwhelming emphasis on coding languages. This approach allowed me to learn the essential skills for a tech career while aligning with my preferences. The decision to pursue this change was significantly motivated by my family, and TripleTen proved to be the ideal partner in this endeavor. The flexibility of the program allowed me to balance learning with my family responsibilities, turning what could have been a stressful transition into a smooth and manageable process. The understanding and support from the TripleTen community and mentors played a pivotal role in keeping me motivated and focused on my goals. The program&#39;s commitment to personal growth and skill expansion resonated deeply with my aspirations. Each module was not just a lesson but a stepping stone towards a more enriched version of myself. The real-world projects and practical applications of data analysis concepts provided a tangible sense of progress, which was both gratifying and motivational. In essence, TripleTen has been more than just an educational program; it has been a partner in my journey of transformation. For anyone looking to break into the tech industry, expand their skill set, and grow both professionally and personally, TripleTen is not just a program – it&#39;s a supportive community that understands and nurtures your unique journey.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Luz Lara&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1704830400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136045689?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66072#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;During the pandemic I started my self-taught journey to become a Web developer, I often found myself lacking consistency and asking myself what should I learn next? As you already probably know there’s a never-ending learning journey ahead and as a self-taught learner back then I often felt discouraged. I reached the conclusion that I would benefit from a structured program. I am currently a Triple Ten student and I will break down why I chose Triple ten and what day to day looks like for me.\n\nWhy Triple Ten? \nI am the only provider in my family and in order for me to be able to commit to a boot camp I needed to be able to keep my full-time job. But I did not want to sacrifice quality. For example, I wanted self -paced but I also wanted deadlines, timely feedback and a community. And that’s exactly what I found with Triple ten. As someone who was also on this website no long ago looking for an answer I would suggest to create a list of things you look for in a boot camp what are things that are negotiable. Write questions you have for the bootcamp. Schedule a call with the recruiters, and do a process of elimination of which program works best for you and your situation. If you need flexibility because you work fulltime , or you a stay at home parent and always have a hectic schedule I believe my review will be the most helpful as this is my current situation. \n\nInteractive platform- This is where you work on your theory (lessons) and after each theory which mainly consist on reading and examining coding examples. Then you work on the task where you immediately have to put in practice what you learned. On this platform you also have a calendar which shows you the schedule for the office hours for your current sprint. My favorite feature is the deadline recommendations. It lets you know where you have to be in order to accomplish the deadlines. An example of this would be: Finish your theory in 8 days. It helps me plan my week without feeling overwhelmed just make tiny goals that at the end will allow me to complete my sprint within my deadline. It also has a Skillset section where you can keep track of the skill sets that you gain as you pass the sprints. Also, a search bar to search through the sprints. The platform is really straightforward and easy to use. \n\nFeedback- This one was a big one on my list because as I was on my self-learning journey I often asked myself I know the code is working but am I doing it the right way? And it frustrated me because I would go to websites like Stack Overflow and everyone had a different way of successfully solving the same problem. I know that this won’t change of course but I am learning the best practices and why is the best practices. Once you are done with the theory plus tasks of your sprint you will work on your project. You will receive documentation on the requirements and a Figma link to the project. After you submit your project a Software engineer will go over your work and point out what you did correctly, what can be improved and what has to be corrected. This feedback has helped me grow tremendously. \n\nCommunity- All the interaction with the community is through Discord. This is the main method of communication. Everyone is assigned a Success manager who is your go to person for extension deadlines questions about the program or if you need to schedule a one on one with the tutors. The times I have missed a deadline my success manager has always been understanding and always show encouragement for me to keep going. My family don’t understand how difficult to grasp the concepts are and is nice to know I have a go to person that completely understands where I am in my journey. \n\nTutors: If you are stuck during Theory part of the sprint or your project you post the questions on discord channel and tutor guide you. Also, each sprint they assign seniors or graduates as well to help tutors with assisting with questions when they(tutors) are offline. They also have co working sessions which I have not been able to participate due to my hectic schedule. They conduct Code jams I haven’t been able to participate but making it a goal to do so.  \n \n\nCareer support- I am currently on sprint 8 therefore I can’t speak much on Job hunting as I am not there yet. What I can say is once you are on Sprint 4-5 you start getting lessons on job hunting, how to have an online presence, what recruiters look for. Before those sprints you also get lessons on the soft skills that are important and employers look for. One of the lessons I have enjoyed the most is the when they illustrate the day to day responsibilities of web developers as it gave me a clear idea and I was able to dig deep and really ask myself if this is what I want to do. I am also glad that they introduce git and GitHub really early into the program. You are added to the career discord channel and you are able to schedule one on ones with the career team. I haven’t done so because my main focus is learning and building right now. Putting into practice the lessons on the career portion of the program but with my main focus right now is to create a strong foundation. \nWith my review I truly hope you are able to get a clear picture on how this program works. Like previously stated I am currently on Sprint 8 there’s a total of 16 sprints. I have had personal challenges along this journey but I have truly felt I have a community behind me and no matter what IT GETS DONE. I truly hope this review was helpful to you reading it I wish you all the best in your journey!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Christion Beddoes&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705089600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66142#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started my TripleTen journey last year after medical events made me incapable of physical work. I took the medical leave as an opportunity to start working towards a new goal. My experience at TripleTen has been fantastic, the layout of the course is easy to comprehend and I feel that I learn something useful with each and every lesson. The lessons are very informative without feeling too overbearing, everything I have learned seems to fit into the reality of software engineering. There is a good balance between theoretical and practical knowledge. However, in my opinion the best part of the TripleTen are the people there to support you. There are tutors anyone can reach out to, a reviewer for each time you submit a project, and a success manager to help with anything else you may have questions about. TripleTen has built an incredible team of people who feel like they genuinely want to see each student succeed. I did some research about which program I wanted to go with regarding my software engineering career,  and I can honestly say that I believe I made the right choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Honey Fly&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705089600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In my life, the moment came when I decided to connect my life with the IT sphere. For a couple of months, I thoroughly studied different directions and tried to determine the specialty that would interest me. I tried myself in design, studying the basics, and wrote code in Java Rush, but I still didn&#39;t come to any specific decision. However, circumstances led me to my friend, who shared his news and said he enrolled in a QA engineer course from TripleTen. It was nice to know someone personally who decided to try himself in IT, and this became a starting point for me in making a rather difficult decision in my life - to purchase the Frontend Developer course from TripleTen. I had no programming background at all. The training program is very well-structured.I try to dedicate 4 hours a day to studying, the main thing is to take breaks on time and not to burn out. TripleTen has a very convenient platform for completing practical assignments and theoretical materials. All the mentors are very responsive and kind. I have already completed half of the program and still remain with a positive impression and i am ready to continue learning to become the best developer I can be.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Fred Lai&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705348800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112486038?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66226#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I did a lot of research into bootcamps before deciding on TripleTen (formerly Practicum). Some of the bootcamps I&#39;ve researched include FlatIron, Thinkful, Springboard, App academy, CodeSmith, etc. After being in the TripleTen bootcamp for several months now, I have to say that I&#39;m very happy with my choice. I’ll list below some of the key things and features that I like about the program. In no particular order:\n1) TripleTen has built-in breaks and extensions for students. During the 1st month or so of the program, a huge crisis came up, that had me sidelined for around a month and a half where I was unable to work on the program. In, I think all of the other bootcamps mentioned above, I would have been kicked out from their program. And they would have kept at least part of my money. Most bootcamps have a policy where if you fall behind (for any reason, even if it’s an emergency), they remove you from the program. TripleTen, on the other hand, has breaks and extensions built into their program that you can take when you need. Even if you didn’t have an emergency situation, I think it’s also totally unreasonable for most of these bootcamps to expect a student to really learn and grasp so much material in such a short amount of time. So I think breaks and extensions are incredibly helpful in that regard. \n2) The people at TripleTen are fantastic! The staff here (from the tutors to the community managers) is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable . Definitely one of the highlights of the program.\n3) TripleTen has periodic projects throughout the course. The program is divided up into what are called Sprints. Each sprint goes through lessons, and teaches you some material. And then at the end of each sprint you are given a project to complete. The projects are by far the most fun part of the course work, in my opinion. You get to implement what you learn, and the brief instructions are usually quite specific with what they want you to do. But there’s also room for creativity and adding your own features as well, if that’s something that you’re interested in doing (as I was). After you submit a project, it gets reviewed, where a reviewer will suggest corrections and improvements.\n4) TripleTen has extra activities. The program has optional side activities that you can participate in such as code jams and externships. In a code jam, you are placed in a team with other students, and you have a project to complete. You compete against other teams. In an externship, you work with other students and a lead developer to actually design and/or implement some kind of project or feature for a real world company. Externships, in particular, are an amazing feature to have in a bootcamp, because it’s real world experience that you can put on your resume. \n5) TripleTen has a money back guarantee. Before you believe any camps money back guarantee, I suggest you read the fine details in their policy section. For instance, Thinkful has a money-back guarantee. But if you actually look into the fine details, their conditions for actually being eligible to claim the money back are incredibly strict. Some of the conditions are so extreme that it seems almost impossible to claim the money back. I won&#39;t go into the details here, but I suggest you look up the policy and decide for yourself. TripleTen on the other hand, has much much less stringent conditions for claiming the money back, which tells me that this bootcamp is confident in being able to land you a job after graduation. 6) TripleTen has Senior Students. Senior students are a group of students who have been accepted by TripleTen to officially help/tutor other students. You don&#39;t necessarily have to be far into the program to become a senior student. You just have to know what you&#39;re doing (for the most part) and be willing to help others. I list this as a feature here, because it&#39;s actually become one of my favorite parts of the program. This may just be me, but I really enjoy working with other students to help fix their code. Not only that, but it gives you a ton of experience, looking at other people&#39;s code and trying to find and fix the issues. I do recommend it. Of course, becoming a senior student is totally optional.\n7) TripleTen has a career program. A significant portion of the program is geared towards landing a job. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end, it&#39;s looking like their career program is extensive, which definitely gives me that extra layer of assurance that I’ll be able to land a job after graduation. I guess, overall, I would say that I highly recommend TripleTen, and that I’m very pleased with my decision to choose them for my bootcamp.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Luke Smeenge&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705435200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65a86f1f1329ae00127923c7/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;They really care about their students success!

I started in May 2023 and am set to graduate in just a few weeks (early February 2024). I had some experience working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before beginning the program which have helped. However, if you’re considering the program and don’t have much background knowledge, the curriculum is so comprehensive, I don’t think it’s totally necessary. I researched a number of bootcamps before starting this one, but TripleTen stood out to me for several reasons. For starters, the externship opportunities that TripleTen offers were something I had never seen with any other program. I also really appreciate the flexibility the program offers. For me, no two weeks look the same, but I average 15-20 hours per week on coursework. They also offer a certain number of extensions if you need extra time to finish a project. I’m a senior student, so I tutor other students as well. It’s given me a chance to meet other learners and practice communicating technical concepts. I also meet with a group of students on Zoom each week to discuss what we’re learning, networking tips, and also just to hang out. Outside of that, I’ve also participated in a Code Jam where I had the opportunity to work on a team of two other students and compete against some of our peers in building and presenting a real project. The code review process that happens at the end of each sprint is really helpful as well. The code reviewers give tips for industry best practices, which have made me so much more confident in my skill level. Overall, I’ve had a really great experience with this program. The community managers and tutors are all really encouraging. With it being a remote program, I was worried I might feel isolated or helpless if I got stuck, but the tutors hold office hours every day and have always been able to help out. I’ve been more than happy with the program, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to switch into a career in tech.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dennis Otieno&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705694400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66325#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I Started on my BI Analysis  journey with TripleTen after graduating with an IT degree from the university of Texas in Dallas and struggling to get a job after graduation. After hundreds of applications and a year after graduation, I came to the realization that I needed to get extra skills in Tech to improve my chances of landing a job. So the idea of a bootcamp came by and after researching multiple bootcamps. I settled on TripleTen after speaking to an advisor and also because of their job guarantee at least six months after graduation and also after reading testimonies about the success rate of their program and graduates. The pricing that was offered by TripleTen was also a factor in choosing it. When I compared their pricing to other Bootcamps, in some instances their pricing was half as much compared to other Bootcamps offering the same classes. On top of that, they had flexible payment plans and also a deferred payment plan that lets you pay only after graduating and getting a job that pays at least $50,000 yearly before starting to pay them back. To make things even better, they guaranteed that if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduation, you will be able to get all your money back. All these made TripleTen unbeatable in the market compared to other bootcamps.       I embarked on the exciting journey of learning BI Analysis with a goal to delve into the world of data and analytics. Choosing the right platform for my analytics  journey was crucial, and after a thorough research, I decided to go with TripleTen. Some of the reasons that TripleTen has become an integral part of my learning experience are many and one of them was the Motivation to Learn. The lecturers were very supportive and helpful in helping to do the projects when stuck. We have a shared discord board among students where one could post a question when stuck on a topic or project and the tutors and other students would suggest ways of getting the problem done without actually giving you the direct answers thereby giving you the motivation to learn and figure out the answer. As with anything new, there will always be instances when you get stuck on something new that you have to learn especially if it&#39;s totally a new concept. I had never done SQL before, and it was challenging. I had constant check in from my tutors asking if they could help, and one I posted a question, I would get a response less than a day letter on how to navigate the said question.       The TripleTen platform is also very interactive making it quite easy to navigate to get answers about topics that one would be stuck in and this also made the task of completing projects manageable. Triple ten also have learning teams, community, and  workshops that have new activities every week to immerse yourself into and also they have learning workshops every day with different tutors covering different topics where one can get answers from depending on what program they are undertaking. TripleTen also introduced me to Github where I could post the projects I have learned so that other students and employers could view my work and increase my chances of getting a job. Through Github , I was also able to collaborate with other students and Github users on their projects by giving suggestions on how to improve on a project posted. I also got introduced to Norton, a platform I had never heard of which has helped me do a professional resume and connect with other like minded people in the analytics field.       The Studying Routine was very flexible and due to this it would be suitable for anyone , whether in school or undertaking a full time job. If you commit roughly 15 hours a week you would be able to meet the project deadlines. I broke down the 15 hours weekly study by studying in the morning every day for two hours and this enabled me to not fall behind and meet the study deadlines that are set out in the platform. The workshops that they offer every day covering different projects made it much easier and fun to figure out problems when stuck with an issue. On top of that, the most valuable aspect of TripleTen is their interactive platform, engaging projects, supportive learning team, a vibrant community, and their insightful workshops.       TripleTen has had a tremendous Impact towards my progress of becoming a BI Analyst. Since I started this journey I have become proficient in Excel, SQL, Tableau and Power BI. Ive become an expert in making engaging dashboards and collecting and cleaning data for analysis. It has also given me great confidence to applying for jobs that need experience because I can now show the products I have worked on as an example of what I can do when it comes to BI Analytics. The advice I can give to Beginners or those that are considering starting a journey in analytics, coding or any bootcamp classes you choose to do is just to begin. Like with everything new, it can look hard at first when you are starting out just like with learning any new subject especially if it is something that you have never done before. Staying motivated is essential even during days when a project seems hard to understand. The best way to approach these days is to always ask questions especially to your tutors and classmates and because you will find that most of the time they have experienced the same issue that you are experiencing. They will always be in a better position to show you how they maneuvered through the question to get to the correct answers and they can explain how you can get to the correct answer yourself.  Effective study habits and leveraging the resources provided by TripleTen would make you successful in your bootcamp journey.       My experience with TripleTen has been nothing short of transformative. The platform&#39;s features, coupled with my commitment and organized study routine, have accelerated my growth in the Analytics field. Most importantly, leverage TripleTen&#39;s resources, and stay dedicated.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jadin D Pauling&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705694400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66324#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After having some experience in the tech field and being rebounded by warehouse work, I wanted to take more steps into the field that interested me and move past average customer support and desktop/smartphone support. After doing some digging and research to find my next move to make this happen. I was advertised to \&quot;Tripleten\&quot; on a social media feed. However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I&#39;ve been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn&#39;t my tutors &amp; community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I&#39;ve spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks &amp; help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there&#39;s even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir &amp; Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I&#39;m confident once I&#39;m done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I&#39;ve encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF&#39;s and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there&#39;s already been good changes made and I&#39;m on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There&#39;s no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others \&quot;5 Stars&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sterling Brayboy&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705867200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Software engineering is fascinating because it gives you the power to understand the same code that built the apps, websites, and artificial technologies that we use every day. I want to build interactive apps and websites for Vision OS and other Metaverse platforms in the future, so I chose the Software Engineering program, and I couldn&#39;t imagine learning how to code with anyone other than TripleTen. TripleTen was recommended to me by a friend and has been a very rewarding experience. TripleTen&#39;s attractive UI/UX makes learning stimulating. I study about 3 hours a day, giving me ample time to digest new material and experiment. When motivation is low, TripleTen offers around-the-clock tutors AND senior students who can assist me with my questions and issues that I may come across with my code. Without such a supportive community, achieving the Front-End skills that I have now would be much more challenging. TripleTen has provided me with professional insight regarding my future career as an engineer - what employers look for, how to prepare for an interview (including technical interviews), as well as becoming a &#39;networking ninja&#39;. TripleTen offers free &#39;externships&#39; that give you the experience that employers look for - allowing you to collaborate with real companies - putting you in a real-life scenario as an engineer, as well as making you more competitive in the job market.TripleTen is a 10/10 experience!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Brian Lopez</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>My journey with TripleTen has been nothing short of a game-changer, especially considering my career change aspirations and the desire to break into the tech industry without diving too deeply into coding.

What truly stands out about TripleTen is its recognition that success in the tech world extends beyond coding alone. As someone not particularly fond of extensive coding, the program&#39;s focus on areas like BI Analytics provided a refreshing alternative. The curriculum was meticulously crafted, offering a comprehensive understanding of data analysis without the overwhelming emphasis on coding languages. This approach allowed me to learn the essential skills for a tech career while aligning with my preferences. The decision to pursue this change was significantly motivated by my family, and TripleTen proved to be the ideal partner in this endeavor. The flexibility of the program allowed me to balance learning with my family responsibilities, turning what could have been a stressful transition into a smooth and manageable process. The understanding and support from the TripleTen community and mentors played a pivotal role in keeping me motivated and focused on my goals. The program&#39;s commitment to personal growth and skill expansion resonated deeply with my aspirations. Each module was not just a lesson but a stepping stone towards a more enriched version of myself. The real-world projects and practical applications of data analysis concepts provided a tangible sense of progress, which was both gratifying and motivational. In essence, TripleTen has been more than just an educational program; it has been a partner in my journey of transformation. For anyone looking to break into the tech industry, expand their skill set, and grow both professionally and personally, TripleTen is not just a program – it&#39;s a supportive community that understands and nurtures your unique journey. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65952#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136045689?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Luz Lara</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>During the pandemic I started my self-taught journey to become a Web developer, I often found myself lacking consistency and asking myself what should I learn next? As you already probably know there’s a never-ending learning journey ahead and as a self-taught learner back then I often felt discoura... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ged. I reached the conclusion that I would benefit from a structured program. I am currently a Triple Ten student and I will break down why I chose Triple ten and what day to day looks like for me.

Why Triple Ten? 
I am the only provider in my family and in order for me to be able to commit to a boot camp I needed to be able to keep my full-time job. But I did not want to sacrifice quality. For example, I wanted self -paced but I also wanted deadlines, timely feedback and a community. And that’s exactly what I found with Triple ten. As someone who was also on this website no long ago looking for an answer I would suggest to create a list of things you look for in a boot camp what are things that are negotiable. Write questions you have for the bootcamp. Schedule a call with the recruiters, and do a process of elimination of which program works best for you and your situation. If you need flexibility because you work fulltime , or you a stay at home parent and always have a hectic schedule I believe my review will be the most helpful as this is my current situation. 

Interactive platform- This is where you work on your theory (lessons) and after each theory which mainly consist on reading and examining coding examples. Then you work on the task where you immediately have to put in practice what you learned. On this platform you also have a calendar which shows you the schedule for the office hours for your current sprint. My favorite feature is the deadline recommendations. It lets you know where you have to be in order to accomplish the deadlines. An example of this would be: Finish your theory in 8 days. It helps me plan my week without feeling overwhelmed just make tiny goals that at the end will allow me to complete my sprint within my deadline. It also has a Skillset section where you can keep track of the skill sets that you gain as you pass the sprints. Also, a search bar to search through the sprints. The platform is really straightforward and easy to use. 

Feedback- This one was a big one on my list because as I was on my self-learning journey I often asked myself I know the code is working but am I doing it the right way? And it frustrated me because I would go to websites like Stack Overflow and everyone had a different way of successfully solving the same problem. I know that this won’t change of course but I am learning the best practices and why is the best practices. Once you are done with the theory plus tasks of your sprint you will work on your project. You will receive documentation on the requirements and a Figma link to the project. After you submit your project a Software engineer will go over your work and point out what you did correctly, what can be improved and what has to be corrected. This feedback has helped me grow tremendously. 

Community- All the interaction with the community is through Discord. This is the main method of communication. Everyone is assigned a Success manager who is your go to person for extension deadlines questions about the program or if you need to schedule a one on one with the tutors. The times I have missed a deadline my success manager has always been understanding and always show encouragement for me to keep going. My family don’t understand how difficult to grasp the concepts are and is nice to know I have a go to person that completely understands where I am in my journey. 

Tutors: If you are stuck during Theory part of the sprint or your project you post the questions on discord channel and tutor guide you. Also, each sprint they assign seniors or graduates as well to help tutors with assisting with questions when they(tutors) are offline. They also have co working sessions which I have not been able to participate due to my hectic schedule. They conduct Code jams I haven’t been able to participate but making it a goal to do so.  
 

Career support- I am currently on sprint 8 therefore I can’t speak much on Job hunting as I am not there yet. What I can say is once you are on Sprint 4-5 you start getting lessons on job hunting, how to have an online presence, what recruiters look for. Before those sprints you also get lessons on the soft skills that are important and employers look for. One of the lessons I have enjoyed the most is the when they illustrate the day to day responsibilities of web developers as it gave me a clear idea and I was able to dig deep and really ask myself if this is what I want to do. I am also glad that they introduce git and GitHub really early into the program. You are added to the career discord channel and you are able to schedule one on ones with the career team. I haven’t done so because my main focus is learning and building right now. Putting into practice the lessons on the career portion of the program but with my main focus right now is to create a strong foundation. 
With my review I truly hope you are able to get a clear picture on how this program works. Like previously stated I am currently on Sprint 8 there’s a total of 16 sprints. I have had personal challenges along this journey but I have truly felt I have a community behind me and no matter what IT GETS DONE. I truly hope this review was helpful to you reading it I wish you all the best in your journey! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66072#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Christion Beddoes</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started my TripleTen journey last year after medical events made me incapable of physical work.

There are tutors anyone can reach out to, a reviewer for each time you submit a project, and a success manager to help with anything else you may have questions about. TripleTen has built an incredible team of people who feel like they genuinely want to see each student succeed. I did some research about which program I wanted to go with regarding my software engineering career,  and I can honestly say that I believe I made the right choice. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66142#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Honey Fly</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>In my life, the moment came when I decided to connect my life with the IT sphere.

However, circumstances led me to my friend, who shared his news and said he enrolled in a QA engineer course from TripleTen. It was nice to know someone personally who decided to try himself in IT, and this became a starting point for me in making a rather difficult decision in my life - to purchase the Frontend Developer course from TripleTen. I had no programming background at all. The training program is very well-structured.I try to dedicate 4 hours a day to studying, the main thing is to take breaks on time and not to burn out. TripleTen has a very convenient platform for completing practical assignments and theoretical materials. All the mentors are very responsive and kind. I have already completed half of the program and still remain with a positive impression and i am ready to continue learning to become the best developer I can be. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112486038?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Fred Lai</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I did a lot of research into bootcamps before deciding on TripleTen (formerly Practicum). Some of the bootcamps I&#39;ve researched include FlatIron, Thinkful, Springboard, App academy, CodeSmith, etc. After being in the TripleTen bootcamp for several months now, I have to say that I&#39;m very happy with m... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>y choice. I’ll list below some of the key things and features that I like about the program. In no particular order:
1) TripleTen has built-in breaks and extensions for students. During the 1st month or so of the program, a huge crisis came up, that had me sidelined for around a month and a half where I was unable to work on the program. In, I think all of the other bootcamps mentioned above, I would have been kicked out from their program. And they would have kept at least part of my money. Most bootcamps have a policy where if you fall behind (for any reason, even if it’s an emergency), they remove you from the program. TripleTen, on the other hand, has breaks and extensions built into their program that you can take when you need. Even if you didn’t have an emergency situation, I think it’s also totally unreasonable for most of these bootcamps to expect a student to really learn and grasp so much material in such a short amount of time. So I think breaks and extensions are incredibly helpful in that regard. 
2) The people at TripleTen are fantastic! The staff here (from the tutors to the community managers) is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable . Definitely one of the highlights of the program.
3) TripleTen has periodic projects throughout the course. The program is divided up into what are called Sprints. Each sprint goes through lessons, and teaches you some material. And then at the end of each sprint you are given a project to complete. The projects are by far the most fun part of the course work, in my opinion. You get to implement what you learn, and the brief instructions are usually quite specific with what they want you to do. But there’s also room for creativity and adding your own features as well, if that’s something that you’re interested in doing (as I was). After you submit a project, it gets reviewed, where a reviewer will suggest corrections and improvements.
4) TripleTen has extra activities. The program has optional side activities that you can participate in such as code jams and externships. In a code jam, you are placed in a team with other students, and you have a project to complete. You compete against other teams. In an externship, you work with other students and a lead developer to actually design and/or implement some kind of project or feature for a real world company. Externships, in particular, are an amazing feature to have in a bootcamp, because it’s real world experience that you can put on your resume. 
5) TripleTen has a money back guarantee. Before you believe any camps money back guarantee, I suggest you read the fine details in their policy section. For instance, Thinkful has a money-back guarantee. But if you actually look into the fine details, their conditions for actually being eligible to claim the money back are incredibly strict. Some of the conditions are so extreme that it seems almost impossible to claim the money back. I won&#39;t go into the details here, but I suggest you look up the policy and decide for yourself. TripleTen on the other hand, has much much less stringent conditions for claiming the money back, which tells me that this bootcamp is confident in being able to land you a job after graduation. 6) TripleTen has Senior Students. Senior students are a group of students who have been accepted by TripleTen to officially help/tutor other students. You don&#39;t necessarily have to be far into the program to become a senior student. You just have to know what you&#39;re doing (for the most part) and be willing to help others. I list this as a feature here, because it&#39;s actually become one of my favorite parts of the program. This may just be me, but I really enjoy working with other students to help fix their code. Not only that, but it gives you a ton of experience, looking at other people&#39;s code and trying to find and fix the issues. I do recommend it. Of course, becoming a senior student is totally optional.
7) TripleTen has a career program. A significant portion of the program is geared towards landing a job. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end, it&#39;s looking like their career program is extensive, which definitely gives me that extra layer of assurance that I’ll be able to land a job after graduation. I guess, overall, I would say that I highly recommend TripleTen, and that I’m very pleased with my decision to choose them for my bootcamp. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66226#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/65a86f1f1329ae00127923c7/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Luke Smeenge</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>They really care about their students success!

I started in May 2023 and am set to graduate in just a few weeks (early February 2024). I had some experience working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before beginning the program which have helped. However, if you’re considering the ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>program and don’t have much background knowledge, the curriculum is so comprehensive, I don’t think it’s totally necessary. I researched a number of bootcamps before starting this one, but TripleTen stood out to me for several reasons. For starters, the externship opportunities that TripleTen offers were something I had never seen with any other program. I also really appreciate the flexibility the program offers. For me, no two weeks look the same, but I average 15-20 hours per week on coursework. They also offer a certain number of extensions if you need extra time to finish a project. I’m a senior student, so I tutor other students as well. It’s given me a chance to meet other learners and practice communicating technical concepts. I also meet with a group of students on Zoom each week to discuss what we’re learning, networking tips, and also just to hang out. Outside of that, I’ve also participated in a Code Jam where I had the opportunity to work on a team of two other students and compete against some of our peers in building and presenting a real project. The code review process that happens at the end of each sprint is really helpful as well. The code reviewers give tips for industry best practices, which have made me so much more confident in my skill level. Overall, I’ve had a really great experience with this program. The community managers and tutors are all really encouraging. With it being a remote program, I was worried I might feel isolated or helpless if I got stuck, but the tutors hold office hours every day and have always been able to help out. I’ve been more than happy with the program, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to switch into a career in tech. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Dennis Otieno</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I Started on my BI Analysis  journey with TripleTen after graduating with an IT degree from the university of Texas in Dallas and struggling to get a job after graduation. After hundreds of applications and a year after graduation, I came to the realization that I needed to get extra skills in Tech ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>to improve my chances of landing a job. So the idea of a bootcamp came by and after researching multiple bootcamps. I settled on TripleTen after speaking to an advisor and also because of their job guarantee at least six months after graduation and also after reading testimonies about the success rate of their program and graduates. The pricing that was offered by TripleTen was also a factor in choosing it. When I compared their pricing to other Bootcamps, in some instances their pricing was half as much compared to other Bootcamps offering the same classes. On top of that, they had flexible payment plans and also a deferred payment plan that lets you pay only after graduating and getting a job that pays at least $50,000 yearly before starting to pay them back. To make things even better, they guaranteed that if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduation, you will be able to get all your money back. All these made TripleTen unbeatable in the market compared to other bootcamps.       I embarked on the exciting journey of learning BI Analysis with a goal to delve into the world of data and analytics. Choosing the right platform for my analytics  journey was crucial, and after a thorough research, I decided to go with TripleTen. Some of the reasons that TripleTen has become an integral part of my learning experience are many and one of them was the Motivation to Learn. The lecturers were very supportive and helpful in helping to do the projects when stuck. We have a shared discord board among students where one could post a question when stuck on a topic or project and the tutors and other students would suggest ways of getting the problem done without actually giving you the direct answers thereby giving you the motivation to learn and figure out the answer. As with anything new, there will always be instances when you get stuck on something new that you have to learn especially if it&#39;s totally a new concept. I had never done SQL before, and it was challenging. I had constant check in from my tutors asking if they could help, and one I posted a question, I would get a response less than a day letter on how to navigate the said question.       The TripleTen platform is also very interactive making it quite easy to navigate to get answers about topics that one would be stuck in and this also made the task of completing projects manageable. Triple ten also have learning teams, community, and  workshops that have new activities every week to immerse yourself into and also they have learning workshops every day with different tutors covering different topics where one can get answers from depending on what program they are undertaking. TripleTen also introduced me to Github where I could post the projects I have learned so that other students and employers could view my work and increase my chances of getting a job. Through Github , I was also able to collaborate with other students and Github users on their projects by giving suggestions on how to improve on a project posted. I also got introduced to Norton, a platform I had never heard of which has helped me do a professional resume and connect with other like minded people in the analytics field.       The Studying Routine was very flexible and due to this it would be suitable for anyone , whether in school or undertaking a full time job. If you commit roughly 15 hours a week you would be able to meet the project deadlines. I broke down the 15 hours weekly study by studying in the morning every day for two hours and this enabled me to not fall behind and meet the study deadlines that are set out in the platform. The workshops that they offer every day covering different projects made it much easier and fun to figure out problems when stuck with an issue. On top of that, the most valuable aspect of TripleTen is their interactive platform, engaging projects, supportive learning team, a vibrant community, and their insightful workshops.       TripleTen has had a tremendous Impact towards my progress of becoming a BI Analyst. Since I started this journey I have become proficient in Excel, SQL, Tableau and Power BI. Ive become an expert in making engaging dashboards and collecting and cleaning data for analysis. It has also given me great confidence to applying for jobs that need experience because I can now show the products I have worked on as an example of what I can do when it comes to BI Analytics. The advice I can give to Beginners or those that are considering starting a journey in analytics, coding or any bootcamp classes you choose to do is just to begin. Like with everything new, it can look hard at first when you are starting out just like with learning any new subject especially if it is something that you have never done before. Staying motivated is essential even during days when a project seems hard to understand. The best way to approach these days is to always ask questions especially to your tutors and classmates and because you will find that most of the time they have experienced the same issue that you are experiencing. They will always be in a better position to show you how they maneuvered through the question to get to the correct answers and they can explain how you can get to the correct answer yourself.  Effective study habits and leveraging the resources provided by TripleTen would make you successful in your bootcamp journey.       My experience with TripleTen has been nothing short of transformative. The platform&#39;s features, coupled with my commitment and organized study routine, have accelerated my growth in the Analytics field. Most importantly, leverage TripleTen&#39;s resources, and stay dedicated. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66325#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jadin D Pauling</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>After having some experience in the tech field and being rebounded by warehouse work, I wanted to take more steps into the field that interested me and move past average customer support and desktop/smartphone support.

However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I&#39;ve been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn&#39;t my tutors &amp; community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I&#39;ve spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks &amp; help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there&#39;s even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir &amp; Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven&#39;t completed the program, so I haven&#39;t fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I&#39;m confident once I&#39;m done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I&#39;ve encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF&#39;s and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there&#39;s already been good changes made and I&#39;m on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There&#39;s no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others &quot;5 Stars </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66324#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sterling Brayboy</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Software engineering is fascinating because it gives you the power to understand the same code that built the apps, websites, and artificial technologies that we use every day.

When motivation is low, TripleTen offers around-the-clock tutors AND senior students who can assist me with my questions and issues that I may come across with my code. Without such a supportive community, achieving the Front-End skills that I have now would be much more challenging. TripleTen has provided me with professional insight regarding my future career as an engineer - what employers look for, how to prepare for an interview (including technical interviews), as well as becoming a &#39;networking ninja&#39;. TripleTen offers free &#39;externships&#39; that give you the experience that employers look for - allowing you to collaborate with real companies - putting you in a real-life scenario as an engineer, as well as making you more competitive in the job market.TripleTen is a 10/10 experience! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../16/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../16/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>16</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>17</span></a><a href="../18/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>18</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../18/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-05T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"My journey with TripleTen has been nothing short of a game-changer, especially considering my career change aspirations and the desire to break into the tech industry without diving too deeply into coding.

The curriculum was meticulously crafted, offering a comprehensive understanding of data analysis without the overwhelming emphasis on coding languages. This approach allowed me to learn the essential skills for a tech career while aligning with my preferences. The decision to pursue this change was significantly motivated by my family, and TripleTen proved to be the ideal partner in this endeavor. The flexibility of the program allowed me to balance learning with my family responsibilities, turning what could have been a stressful transition into a smooth and manageable process. The understanding and support from the TripleTen community and mentors played a pivotal role in keeping me motivated and focused on my goals. The program's commitment to personal growth and skill expansion resonated deeply with my aspirations. Each module was not just a lesson but a stepping stone towards a more enriched version of myself. The real-world projects and practical applications of data analysis concepts provided a tangible sense of progress, which was both gratifying and motivational. In essence, TripleTen has been more than just an educational program; it has been a partner in my journey of transformation. For anyone looking to break into the tech industry, expand their skill set, and grow both professionally and personally, TripleTen is not just a program – it's a supportive community that understands and nurtures your unique journey.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brian Lopez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"During the pandemic I started my self-taught journey to become a Web developer, I often found myself lacking consistency and asking myself what should I learn next? As you already probably know there’s a never-ending learning journey ahead and as a self-taught learner back then I often felt discouraged. I reached the conclusion that I would benefit from a structured program. I am currently a Triple Ten student and I will break down why I chose Triple ten and what day to day looks like for me.\n\nWhy Triple Ten? \nI am the only provider in my family and in order for me to be able to commit to a boot camp I needed to be able to keep my full-time job. But I did not want to sacrifice quality. For example, I wanted self -paced but I also wanted deadlines, timely feedback and a community. And that’s exactly what I found with Triple ten. As someone who was also on this website no long ago looking for an answer I would suggest to create a list of things you look for in a boot camp what are things that are negotiable. Write questions you have for the bootcamp. Schedule a call with the recruiters, and do a process of elimination of which program works best for you and your situation. If you need flexibility because you work fulltime , or you a stay at home parent and always have a hectic schedule I believe my review will be the most helpful as this is my current situation. \n\nInteractive platform- This is where you work on your theory (lessons) and after each theory which mainly consist on reading and examining coding examples. Then you work on the task where you immediately have to put in practice what you learned. On this platform you also have a calendar which shows you the schedule for the office hours for your current sprint. My favorite feature is the deadline recommendations. It lets you know where you have to be in order to accomplish the deadlines. An example of this would be: Finish your theory in 8 days. It helps me plan my week without feeling overwhelmed just make tiny goals that at the end will allow me to complete my sprint within my deadline. It also has a Skillset section where you can keep track of the skill sets that you gain as you pass the sprints. Also, a search bar to search through the sprints. The platform is really straightforward and easy to use. \n\nFeedback- This one was a big one on my list because as I was on my self-learning journey I often asked myself I know the code is working but am I doing it the right way? And it frustrated me because I would go to websites like Stack Overflow and everyone had a different way of successfully solving the same problem. I know that this won’t change of course but I am learning the best practices and why is the best practices. Once you are done with the theory plus tasks of your sprint you will work on your project. You will receive documentation on the requirements and a Figma link to the project. After you submit your project a Software engineer will go over your work and point out what you did correctly, what can be improved and what has to be corrected. This feedback has helped me grow tremendously. \n\nCommunity- All the interaction with the community is through Discord. This is the main method of communication. Everyone is assigned a Success manager who is your go to person for extension deadlines questions about the program or if you need to schedule a one on one with the tutors. The times I have missed a deadline my success manager has always been understanding and always show encouragement for me to keep going. My family don’t understand how difficult to grasp the concepts are and is nice to know I have a go to person that completely understands where I am in my journey. \n\nTutors: If you are stuck during Theory part of the sprint or your project you post the questions on discord channel and tutor guide you. Also, each sprint they assign seniors or graduates as well to help tutors with assisting with questions when they(tutors) are offline. They also have co working sessions which I have not been able to participate due to my hectic schedule. They conduct Code jams I haven’t been able to participate but making it a goal to do so.  \n \n\nCareer support- I am currently on sprint 8 therefore I can’t speak much on Job hunting as I am not there yet. What I can say is once you are on Sprint 4-5 you start getting lessons on job hunting, how to have an online presence, what recruiters look for. Before those sprints you also get lessons on the soft skills that are important and employers look for. One of the lessons I have enjoyed the most is the when they illustrate the day to day responsibilities of web developers as it gave me a clear idea and I was able to dig deep and really ask myself if this is what I want to do. I am also glad that they introduce git and GitHub really early into the program. You are added to the career discord channel and you are able to schedule one on ones with the career team. I haven’t done so because my main focus is learning and building right now. Putting into practice the lessons on the career portion of the program but with my main focus right now is to create a strong foundation. \nWith my review I truly hope you are able to get a clear picture on how this program works. Like previously stated I am currently on Sprint 8 there’s a total of 16 sprints. I have had personal challenges along this journey but I have truly felt I have a community behind me and no matter what IT GETS DONE. I truly hope this review was helpful to you reading it I wish you all the best in your journey!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Luz Lara"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started my TripleTen journey last year after medical events made me incapable of physical work. I took the medical leave as an opportunity to start working towards a new goal. My experience at TripleTen has been fantastic, the layout of the course is easy to comprehend and I feel that I learn something useful with each and every lesson. The lessons are very informative without feeling too overbearing, everything I have learned seems to fit into the reality of software engineering. There is a good balance between theoretical and practical knowledge. However, in my opinion the best part of the TripleTen are the people there to support you. There are tutors anyone can reach out to, a reviewer for each time you submit a project, and a success manager to help with anything else you may have questions about. TripleTen has built an incredible team of people who feel like they genuinely want to see each student succeed. I did some research about which program I wanted to go with regarding my software engineering career,  and I can honestly say that I believe I made the right choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christion Beddoes"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"In my life, the moment came when I decided to connect my life with the IT sphere. For a couple of months, I thoroughly studied different directions and tried to determine the specialty that would interest me. I tried myself in design, studying the basics, and wrote code in Java Rush, but I still didn't come to any specific decision. However, circumstances led me to my friend, who shared his news and said he enrolled in a QA engineer course from TripleTen. It was nice to know someone personally who decided to try himself in IT, and this became a starting point for me in making a rather difficult decision in my life - to purchase the Frontend Developer course from TripleTen. I had no programming background at all. The training program is very well-structured.I try to dedicate 4 hours a day to studying, the main thing is to take breaks on time and not to burn out. TripleTen has a very convenient platform for completing practical assignments and theoretical materials. All the mentors are very responsive and kind. I have already completed half of the program and still remain with a positive impression and i am ready to continue learning to become the best developer I can be.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Honey Fly"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-15T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I did a lot of research into bootcamps before deciding on TripleTen (formerly Practicum). Some of the bootcamps I've researched include FlatIron, Thinkful, Springboard, App academy, CodeSmith, etc. After being in the TripleTen bootcamp for several months now, I have to say that I'm very happy with my choice. I’ll list below some of the key things and features that I like about the program. In no particular order:\n1) TripleTen has built-in breaks and extensions for students. During the 1st month or so of the program, a huge crisis came up, that had me sidelined for around a month and a half where I was unable to work on the program. In, I think all of the other bootcamps mentioned above, I would have been kicked out from their program. And they would have kept at least part of my money. Most bootcamps have a policy where if you fall behind (for any reason, even if it’s an emergency), they remove you from the program. TripleTen, on the other hand, has breaks and extensions built into their program that you can take when you need. Even if you didn’t have an emergency situation, I think it’s also totally unreasonable for most of these bootcamps to expect a student to really learn and grasp so much material in such a short amount of time. So I think breaks and extensions are incredibly helpful in that regard. \n2) The people at TripleTen are fantastic! The staff here (from the tutors to the community managers) is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable . Definitely one of the highlights of the program.\n3) TripleTen has periodic projects throughout the course. The program is divided up into what are called Sprints. Each sprint goes through lessons, and teaches you some material. And then at the end of each sprint you are given a project to complete. The projects are by far the most fun part of the course work, in my opinion. You get to implement what you learn, and the brief instructions are usually quite specific with what they want you to do. But there’s also room for creativity and adding your own features as well, if that’s something that you’re interested in doing (as I was). After you submit a project, it gets reviewed, where a reviewer will suggest corrections and improvements.\n4) TripleTen has extra activities. The program has optional side activities that you can participate in such as code jams and externships. In a code jam, you are placed in a team with other students, and you have a project to complete. You compete against other teams. In an externship, you work with other students and a lead developer to actually design and/or implement some kind of project or feature for a real world company. Externships, in particular, are an amazing feature to have in a bootcamp, because it’s real world experience that you can put on your resume. \n5) TripleTen has a money back guarantee. Before you believe any camps money back guarantee, I suggest you read the fine details in their policy section. For instance, Thinkful has a money-back guarantee. But if you actually look into the fine details, their conditions for actually being eligible to claim the money back are incredibly strict. Some of the conditions are so extreme that it seems almost impossible to claim the money back. I won't go into the details here, but I suggest you look up the policy and decide for yourself. TripleTen on the other hand, has much much less stringent conditions for claiming the money back, which tells me that this bootcamp is confident in being able to land you a job after graduation. 6) TripleTen has Senior Students. Senior students are a group of students who have been accepted by TripleTen to officially help/tutor other students. You don't necessarily have to be far into the program to become a senior student. You just have to know what you're doing (for the most part) and be willing to help others. I list this as a feature here, because it's actually become one of my favorite parts of the program. This may just be me, but I really enjoy working with other students to help fix their code. Not only that, but it gives you a ton of experience, looking at other people's code and trying to find and fix the issues. I do recommend it. Of course, becoming a senior student is totally optional.\n7) TripleTen has a career program. A significant portion of the program is geared towards landing a job. I haven't completed the program, so I haven't fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end, it's looking like their career program is extensive, which definitely gives me that extra layer of assurance that I’ll be able to land a job after graduation. I guess, overall, I would say that I highly recommend TripleTen, and that I’m very pleased with my decision to choose them for my bootcamp.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fred Lai"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-16T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"They really care about their students success!

I started in May 2023 and am set to graduate in just a few weeks (early February 2024). I had some experience working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before beginning the program which have helped. However, if you’re considering the program and don’t have much background knowledge, the curriculum is so comprehensive, I don’t think it’s totally necessary. I researched a number of bootcamps before starting this one, but TripleTen stood out to me for several reasons. For starters, the externship opportunities that TripleTen offers were something I had never seen with any other program. I also really appreciate the flexibility the program offers. For me, no two weeks look the same, but I average 15-20 hours per week on coursework. They also offer a certain number of extensions if you need extra time to finish a project. I’m a senior student, so I tutor other students as well. It’s given me a chance to meet other learners and practice communicating technical concepts. I also meet with a group of students on Zoom each week to discuss what we’re learning, networking tips, and also just to hang out. Outside of that, I’ve also participated in a Code Jam where I had the opportunity to work on a team of two other students and compete against some of our peers in building and presenting a real project. The code review process that happens at the end of each sprint is really helpful as well. The code reviewers give tips for industry best practices, which have made me so much more confident in my skill level. Overall, I’ve had a really great experience with this program. The community managers and tutors are all really encouraging. With it being a remote program, I was worried I might feel isolated or helpless if I got stuck, but the tutors hold office hours every day and have always been able to help out. I’ve been more than happy with the program, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to switch into a career in tech.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chandlar Lanier"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I Started on my BI Analysis  journey with TripleTen after graduating with an IT degree from the university of Texas in Dallas and struggling to get a job after graduation. After hundreds of applications and a year after graduation, I came to the realization that I needed to get extra skills in Tech to improve my chances of landing a job. So the idea of a bootcamp came by and after researching multiple bootcamps. I settled on TripleTen after speaking to an advisor and also because of their job guarantee at least six months after graduation and also after reading testimonies about the success rate of their program and graduates. The pricing that was offered by TripleTen was also a factor in choosing it. When I compared their pricing to other Bootcamps, in some instances their pricing was half as much compared to other Bootcamps offering the same classes. On top of that, they had flexible payment plans and also a deferred payment plan that lets you pay only after graduating and getting a job that pays at least $50,000 yearly before starting to pay them back. To make things even better, they guaranteed that if you don't get a job within six months after graduation, you will be able to get all your money back. All these made TripleTen unbeatable in the market compared to other bootcamps.       I embarked on the exciting journey of learning BI Analysis with a goal to delve into the world of data and analytics. Choosing the right platform for my analytics  journey was crucial, and after a thorough research, I decided to go with TripleTen. Some of the reasons that TripleTen has become an integral part of my learning experience are many and one of them was the Motivation to Learn. The lecturers were very supportive and helpful in helping to do the projects when stuck. We have a shared discord board among students where one could post a question when stuck on a topic or project and the tutors and other students would suggest ways of getting the problem done without actually giving you the direct answers thereby giving you the motivation to learn and figure out the answer. As with anything new, there will always be instances when you get stuck on something new that you have to learn especially if it's totally a new concept. I had never done SQL before, and it was challenging. I had constant check in from my tutors asking if they could help, and one I posted a question, I would get a response less than a day letter on how to navigate the said question.       The TripleTen platform is also very interactive making it quite easy to navigate to get answers about topics that one would be stuck in and this also made the task of completing projects manageable. Triple ten also have learning teams, community, and  workshops that have new activities every week to immerse yourself into and also they have learning workshops every day with different tutors covering different topics where one can get answers from depending on what program they are undertaking. TripleTen also introduced me to Github where I could post the projects I have learned so that other students and employers could view my work and increase my chances of getting a job. Through Github , I was also able to collaborate with other students and Github users on their projects by giving suggestions on how to improve on a project posted. I also got introduced to Norton, a platform I had never heard of which has helped me do a professional resume and connect with other like minded people in the analytics field.       The Studying Routine was very flexible and due to this it would be suitable for anyone , whether in school or undertaking a full time job. If you commit roughly 15 hours a week you would be able to meet the project deadlines. I broke down the 15 hours weekly study by studying in the morning every day for two hours and this enabled me to not fall behind and meet the study deadlines that are set out in the platform. The workshops that they offer every day covering different projects made it much easier and fun to figure out problems when stuck with an issue. On top of that, the most valuable aspect of TripleTen is their interactive platform, engaging projects, supportive learning team, a vibrant community, and their insightful workshops.       TripleTen has had a tremendous Impact towards my progress of becoming a BI Analyst. Since I started this journey I have become proficient in Excel, SQL, Tableau and Power BI. Ive become an expert in making engaging dashboards and collecting and cleaning data for analysis. It has also given me great confidence to applying for jobs that need experience because I can now show the products I have worked on as an example of what I can do when it comes to BI Analytics. The advice I can give to Beginners or those that are considering starting a journey in analytics, coding or any bootcamp classes you choose to do is just to begin. Like with everything new, it can look hard at first when you are starting out just like with learning any new subject especially if it is something that you have never done before. Staying motivated is essential even during days when a project seems hard to understand. The best way to approach these days is to always ask questions especially to your tutors and classmates and because you will find that most of the time they have experienced the same issue that you are experiencing. They will always be in a better position to show you how they maneuvered through the question to get to the correct answers and they can explain how you can get to the correct answer yourself.  Effective study habits and leveraging the resources provided by TripleTen would make you successful in your bootcamp journey.       My experience with TripleTen has been nothing short of transformative. The platform's features, coupled with my commitment and organized study routine, have accelerated my growth in the Analytics field. Most importantly, leverage TripleTen's resources, and stay dedicated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dennis Otieno"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After having some experience in the tech field and being rebounded by warehouse work, I wanted to take more steps into the field that interested me and move past average customer support and desktop/smartphone support. After doing some digging and research to find my next move to make this happen. I was advertised to \"Tripleten\" on a social media feed. However, a bit skeptical I did have a chance to research other camps but the course I chose here at Tripleten (Quality Assurance Engineering) had all the courses I needed to become a knowledgeable QA. The reason I chose Tripleten is that while doing my research I did have the chance to sit in on some Zoom calls with other camps but this one was a phone appointment. I had the chance to talk to Ron Schurr personally and ask separate questions from notes I've been taking and its learning curriculum was what I needed while working with a volume-based schedule. I normally carved out 3-5 hours a day or every other day to make sure I digested what I learned and anything I didn't my tutors & community managers always had some answer or someone who can get you what you needed.The course and curriculum is layed out very nicely and its becoming very intuitive. From the time I've spent in the course I personally just enjoy the simplicity, the information is easy to find, the calendars are clear and all the tutors are available at different times to meet everyone needs. Theres always updates in the community discord for career talks & help, Old and active open chats to help you along with each section and there's even a place to find a study buddy. Id also like to highlight my success managers (Vladimir & Irene) these people care and make sure your striving for your goal or help you with any course issues you may encounter. Super friendly. TripleTen has a career program. I haven't completed the program, so I haven't fully dived into the career part yet. But as I approach the end there are courses that explain it has externships and how well just from graduating from here can help you land a job as a QA. I'm confident once I'm done and talk to the career counselors ill be fully prepared to get that job.After explaining all of the great this course and curriculum can bring there are some snags that I've encountered but nothing insanely major. There honestly very little this QA course that needs to be fixed. Just some more visual explanations videos or GIF's and re-structure or wording of some stuff to make it hit home. However, there's already been good changes made and I'm on the last Sprint of the Curriculum. There's no doubt that id recommend this Bootcamp to others \"5 Stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jadin D Pauling"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-21T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Software engineering is fascinating because it gives you the power to understand the same code that built the apps, websites, and artificial technologies that we use every day. I want to build interactive apps and websites for Vision OS and other Metaverse platforms in the future, so I chose the Software Engineering program, and I couldn't imagine learning how to code with anyone other than TripleTen. TripleTen was recommended to me by a friend and has been a very rewarding experience. TripleTen's attractive UI/UX makes learning stimulating. I study about 3 hours a day, giving me ample time to digest new material and experiment. When motivation is low, TripleTen offers around-the-clock tutors AND senior students who can assist me with my questions and issues that I may come across with my code. Without such a supportive community, achieving the Front-End skills that I have now would be much more challenging. TripleTen has provided me with professional insight regarding my future career as an engineer - what employers look for, how to prepare for an interview (including technical interviews), as well as becoming a 'networking ninja'. TripleTen offers free 'externships' that give you the experience that employers look for - allowing you to collaborate with real companies - putting you in a real-life scenario as an engineer, as well as making you more competitive in the job market.TripleTen is a 10/10 experience!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sterling Brayboy"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
