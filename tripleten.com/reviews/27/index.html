I like what I do but I needed something different. The reason why I chose to start in BI Analysis, is because I decided I needed a change. I wanted to do something that challenged me and wanted something that I enjoyed doing. I didn&#39;t know anything about business intelligence analysis, so this is brand new territory. I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp&#39;s completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don&#39;t have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn&#39;t a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can&#39;t put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen&#39;s features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn&#39;t something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out. If you plan on starting your bootcamp journey with TripleTen, you will not be disappointed! You will have your ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the bad. Like me, you will not be disappointed!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Byron L.&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1715976000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My journey with triple ten has been a challenging, yet exciting journey so far. The staff has been overall supportive and understanding even at times when I needed special accommodations. I chose to start the Data Scientist program because I knew I was interested in tech, but I wasn’t sure whether or not I wanted to be a software engineer. TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Muhammad Aleem</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>The tripleten Software Engineering Program, known as the bootcamp, provided me with an invaluable opportunity to delve into the world of programming languages and master the fundamentals.

Moreover, the tantalizing prospect of comprehensive career support and a sacrosanct job guarantee, contingent upon the attainment of clearly delineated metrics, served as an inviolable bulwark against the vicissitudes of such an audacious undertaking, assuaging the trepidations that inevitably accompany any metamorphic journey.Your exegesis of the immersive, interactive platform and the complementary Discord-based channels for communication offered a scintillating aperture into the pedagogical experience itself. While the platform&#39;s intuitive architecture facilitated an effortless immersion into the realms of knowledge, the imperative to remain ever-vigilant, closely monitoring the Discord channels for critical announcements and updates, posed a formidable challenge to your determination, underscoring the inextricable link between diligence and self-directed learning.Your sagacious acknowledgment of the program&#39;s suitability for those possessed of an innate propensity for self-motivation and temporal self-governance is a perspicacious observation, serving as a clarion call to prospective participants to engage in profound introspection and assess their aptitude for such an autonomous educational paradigm. Failure to heed this admonition could imperil their chances of success, rendering the entire endeavor a profitless exercise in futility.Moreover, your willingness to supplement the prescribed curriculum with auxiliary learning resources during your sojourn through the abstruse realms of programming languages is a testament to your unwavering commitment to mastery and your indefatigable pursuit of comprehensive understanding. This resilience and adaptability, this refusal to acquiesce in the face of academic adversity, are qualities that shall serve you well as you navigate the ever-shifting techno-landscape.As you now stand poised upon the precipice of your professional genesis, armed with the multifarious skillset cultivated through your immersion in the TripleTen crucible, I can but offer you my most fervent benedictions for persistence and triumph. Your odyssey thus far has been a resplendent validation of your capacity for personal and professional metamorphosis, an indelible testament to the indomitability of the human spirit when confronted with the exigencies of change. I harbor no trepidation that your unwavering determination and unconquerable resolve shall propel you inexorably towards realms of remunerative and personally gratifying endeavors. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68953#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Mark Gabaya</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen&#39;s Data Science program overall has been a great experience.

At TripleTen, the curriculum is designed with both theoretical knowledge and practical assignments, creating an immersive learning experience. Learning by doing has accelerated my understanding of programming concepts, making complex topics more digestible. I dedicate around 17-20 hours per week to studying, finding a balance between coursework and personal projects.
One of the standout features of TripleTen is its interactive platform. It provides a dynamic learning environment where I can engage with course materials, collaborate with peers, and track my progress. The emphasis on projects in every sprint adds a real-world dimension to my learning, allowing me to apply newfound skills to tangible outcomes.
Beyond the curriculum, TripleTen fosters a supportive community. From learning teams to workshops, there are ample opportunities for collaboration and growth. The sense of camaraderie amongst fellow learners creates an environment conducive to success.
TripleTen has not only equipped me with technical skills but also provided invaluable support in achieving my goals of becoming a software engineer. Already, I&#39;m securing opportunities to build my portfolio, thanks to the practical experience gained through the program.
To those just beginning their coding journey, my advice is simple: perseverance is key. Like learning a new language, programming can be challenging at first. However, with dedication and practice, the once daunting concepts will become second nature. Trust in the process and don&#39;t hesitate to lean on the supportive community at TripleTen for guidance.
TripleTen has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It has empowered me to pursue my passion for technology while offering the flexibility I desire in my career. I wholeheartedly recommend TripleTen to anyone embarking on their journey into software engineering. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=68988#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Robert Pickett</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.

I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp&#39;s completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don&#39;t have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn&#39;t a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can&#39;t put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen&#39;s features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn&#39;t something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out. If you plan on starting your bootcamp journey with TripleTen, you will not be disappointed! You will have your ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the bad.

TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../26/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../26/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>26</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>27</span></a><a href="../28/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>28</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../28/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-04-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"The tripleten Software Engineering Program, known as the bootcamp, provided me with an invaluable opportunity to delve into the world of programming languages and master the fundamentals.

I like what I do but I needed something different. The reason why I chose to start in BI Analysis, is because I decided I needed a change. I wanted to do something that challenged me and wanted something that I enjoyed doing. I didn't know anything about business intelligence analysis, so this is brand new territory. I liked what I learned and cannot wait to put it to use. I chose TripleTen because after seeing it on social media quite a bit and seeing the 90% hiring rate after the bootcamp's completion, I figured I give it a shot because I like those odds. My study process is kind of all over the place, I don't have a set way of studying. What I do is get my most important tasks done like my full time job and time with my family. Then I would go to my home office, get my notebook ready and start going at it. My success manager asked if I could spend about 15-20 hours a week, which isn't a huge a time consumer. I would say I spent probably 20-30 hours a week, maybe even more. It all just depended on if I wanted to study or play games in my free time, which I usually chose studying because I found this field intriguing and wanted to get in this field quicker. When it comes to something that intrigues me, I can't put it down. What I liked most about TripleTen's features were the projects and and the interactive platform. The projects were fun simply because it was new to me and I like learning new things. The interactive platform was nice, if I were to get a a question wrong, it explained why it was wrong and I could go back and see why it was wrong and fix my mistake. I wish I took more advantage of the workshops but were unable to attend due to my scheduling either my full time job or time with the family. TripleTen has equipped me for success. I liked everything that it showed me, it was easy to comprehend. If there wasn't something I understood, it was easy to get in contact with someone because of the sites and and discord channels to help out. If you plan on starting your bootcamp journey with TripleTen, you will not be disappointed! You will have your ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the bad. Like me, you will not be disappointed!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cameron Lee"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"My journey with triple ten has been a challenging, yet exciting journey so far. The staff has been overall supportive and understanding even at times when I needed special accommodations. I chose to start the Data Scientist program because I knew I was interested in tech, but I wasn’t sure whether or not I wanted to be a software engineer. TripleTen was kind and convenient enough to provide me with a personality test which resulted in the Data Science program being the best fit for me. I chose TripleTen because I felt like it was the best program for the price and TripleTen also had good reviews as well. Other programs either charged less with possibly lower quality instruction or charged way more than I was willing to pay for a tech bootcamp. TripleTen also offers an externship which can serve as real world experience on a resume. TripleTen also offers career services, which I am a big fan of as well.  I study with TripleTen through group study sessions called coworking. Also, TripleTen has the awesome convenience of providing me with a one on one session with a tutor if I am really stuck on a task.  I also like the idea of using tech and coding skills for business purposes as well. I try to organize my studying by reading the overall material at least twice. I, myself like to dedicate anywhere around 30 to 35 hours per week studying. As mentioned earlier in my review, I rely mainly on coworking and one on one sessions for studying, as well as study hours when a tutor is available to respond to questions using Discord. TripleTen also does provide a couple of instructional videos when needed in order to understand the lesson. From time to time there are also live, interactive workshops with a skilled tutor that help with learning as well. The features that I like about TripleTen are: the very informative and concise study materials included in the course, the projects that allow you to master the basics of coding and other tasks, the supportive staff of tutors and success advisors, and the use of sprint channel, which work somewhat as blogs that students can post questions about tasks or concept that they are unsure about in which a tutor can give a timely reply. TripleTen helped me feel more confident about learning coding and Data Science overall by breaking down the basics coding from a beginner friendly standpoint through study materials, instructional videos, coding exercises and projects to help you practice and perfect your coding skills. My best advice to a student beginning their coding journey is to be consistent and not give up. Coming from a work history with little to no computer skills, coding was challenging at first, but it became easier over time with studying and performing coding tasks. The hard work and consistency will really pay off!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Byron L."},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
