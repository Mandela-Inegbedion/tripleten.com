Now that I have graduated my knowledge and understanding of code has grown exponentially. I can’t recommend Triple Ten enough for anyone who has never given coding a chance.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Jaurigue&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As I close this chapter on my journey at TripleTen, I can&#39;t help but feel a warm sense of achievement. When I first stepped into TripleTen, there were a few things I was hunting for in a coding bootcamp.\n\nFlexibility was my first must-have. Juggling a full-time job meant I needed a program that would understand when I clocked in and out wasn&#39;t always going to be conventional. TripleTen, with its understanding and adaptable approach, made sure this was never a problem.\n\nSecondly, I was searching for a strong support network. I knew cracking the code (pun intended!) wasn&#39;t going to be a piece of cake. But I also knew that with the right people to guide me and a supportive community to fall back on, I&#39;d get there. And TripleTen didn’t let me down. The tutors and the community members were absolute gems, always ready to help. I can&#39;t thank the super helpful tutors at TripleTen enough!\n\nLastly, I was on the lookout for relevant and up-to-date learning resources. When I first decided to learn to code, I wasn&#39;t quite sure what I was getting myself into. But a bit of research pointed me towards the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I realized this was a solid foundation for anyone wanting to dive into creating web applications with a team. And TripleTen nailed it here too, providing a course that was not just comprehensive, but bang up-to-date.\n\nTo sum up, TripleTen has been one heck of a ride! I&#39;ve come out the other side not just with coding skills, but also with the confidence to face whatever comes next in my career. A big thank you to the entire team at TripleTen. You guys rock!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Powers&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started as a high school math teacher for three years. I attended a four year university and spent about $75,000 on my four year degree that I ended up quitting after just three years. My backup plan was computer science in some way, and I found this company. I was a little weary about data science because it was so rigorous and included learning AI which I assumed was beyond my ability. \n\nOne year, and less than $8,000 later, I now have a job making over double my teacher salary. The career program in this course is also very rigorous, and will take a 2-3 weeks to get your portfolio to their standards. It does help in the long run, but I personally did not love the process. \n\nThe projects their courses offer are from real companies giving you real work anywhere from 2000-2017. Yes, the data may be a little old, but it gives you that real world feeling. Also, every project must be approved by one of their trained professionals. If your project is not approved, they will supply you with feedback on your mistakes and where they can be found.\n\nEvery single sprint consists of theoretical pages that give you deep insight on the skill you will be achieving. After the theory, it is common that you will be asked to demonstrate that theory the old fashioned way. For example, by hand calculate the product of two matrices. After learning how to perform that skill, and why it works, then they will show you where someone programmed it so you never have to do it by hand again. This was great for understanding the terminology rather than just saying big words and putting code to it. \n\nLastly, there is weekly office hours for tutors to help you on your project or sprint lessons, and there is weekly coworking sessions where students get together and try to figure out things together. It is a great community and maintains high professional status.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Samiotes&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I became interested in shifting to a career in technology after I was introduced to some rudimentary coding techniques related to a hobby. After some online research, I selected the Business Intelligence Analyst program at TripleTen for their flexible schedule, support staff, and career assistance programs. Some of the sprints were more difficult than others, but I was always able to receive any necessary help from the program&#39;s tutors. I enjoyed learning about the various techniques and formulas needed to manipulate the data to find desired answers. When we used programs that I was at least somewhat familiar with, such as Excel, the lessons were still informative and useful. When we moved on to programs that I had not heard of, such as Tableau, the lessons were detailed enough that I was able to follow along without issue.\n\nBesides resolving my difficulties completing the coursework, the TripleTen tutors were also always available to answer my questions concerning strategies and what it was like to actually work in the profession. I sent messages that were always promptly answered (except one time when the person I had messaged got the flu), and the video conference I arranged was very informative, supportive, and arranged around my schedule.\n\nThe projects at the end of each sprint were good summations of the material, which both assisted me through a real-world problem and forced me to think critically about how to solve one. When my projects were reviewed, the feedback was returned quickly, and it was generally helpful and specific. Their comments gave me useful insights into not only how to improve the general quality of my work but how to maximize the professionalism of what I was presenting and adhere to subtle industry expectations.\n\nSince I have only recently graduated from the main BIA program, I have not yet had the opportunity to participate in one of their externships. But I look forward to receiving a task from an actual company and completing it under guidance of the TripleTen tutors. I sometimes lack confidence, and I believe this program will help me to have more faith that my newly acquired skills can successfully be translated into a career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Mirko Zlatunic&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;If you are looking for a new career in tech but want to learn in your free time and space, then this program is perfect for you.

What I liked most about the program was its self-paced structure, which allowed me to tailor my learning journey while adhering to a timeline. As someone without a technical background, I sometimes found the program&#39;s materials overwhelming. However, my community manager regularly checked in on my progress and made sure that I was on the right track. They provided invaluable guidance and ensured that I never felt lost. In addition, tutors and office hours were always available whenever I needed extra help. The program&#39;s main goal was to equip me with the technical skills required to thrive as a data scientist, and it succeeded. I went from having no technical background to feeling confident in my abilities to handle data science tasks and projects. Tripleten also provides career support. I&#39;m currently working with a career manager who is helping me fine-tune my resume, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub.

My name is Ryan, and I am excited to share my thoughts on this program that not only shaped my technical skills but also provided a unique and flexible learning experience.\n\nThe course, initially estimated at 10 months, took me about 11 months to complete. This extended duration was partly due to planned breaks that I strategically incorporated throughout the year. However, the flexibility offered by Tripleten was a key factor that allowed me to navigate through the program at my own pace.\n\nOne of the standout features of the course is its well-thought-out structure, which mirrors the real-world project management approach. The use of sprints, a concept familiar to many tech professionals, facilitates effective time management. In my current workplace, we employ a similar sprint methodology to ensure timely project completion and maintain focus. This approach at Tripleten empowered me to plan my schedule, allocate time for each two-week sprint/project, and even work ahead if possible. The allowance for working ahead and the provision of ample time for those who might struggle with specific course components contributed to a supportive and inclusive learning environment.\n\nHaving previously attempted another bootcamp, I found that Tripleten aligned better with my learning style and schedule. The collaborative nature of the course encouraged interaction with fellow learners, fostering an environment where ideas could be shared, and challenges could be collectively addressed. Making mistakes and not immediately grasping concepts was acceptable, as the program provided the necessary resources for self-correction. The exceptional tutors played a pivotal role in this regard. Their responsiveness, even during late-night hours, was a testament to their dedication. The availability of tutors, coupled with supplementary resources, proved instrumental in my success.\n\nThe projects, a significant component of the course, were rigorously assessed by proficient code reviewers. The stringent grading criteria aimed at ensuring the quality of the code. While the critiques were meticulous, they were constructive and aimed at pushing students to produce their best work. These projects, reflecting real-world scenarios, became valuable additions to my GitHub portfolio. From crafting a personal \&quot;about me\&quot; page to developing a small social media platform and a weather-based outfit suggestion site with user accounts, the projects showcased diverse skills applicable in the industry.\n\nTripleten also offered opportunities for participation in extra activities such as code jams, enhancing the understanding of core concepts. Though I, personally, couldn&#39;t take full advantage due to my full-time work commitments, I recognize the potential benefits for those able to engage in these supplementary activities.\n\nThe career review segment, yet to be fully explored by me as it initiates post-course completion, promises to be a valuable resource. This aspect involves a comprehensive review of resumes, cover letters, and a detailed discussion on effective job application strategies within the industry.\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive aspects of the program, a few challenges have been encountered. The constant updates to the curriculum, while ensuring its relevance, presented a hurdle during my course. Adjusting to changes in project requirements and learning new concepts simultaneously added a layer of complexity to the learning process. Additionally, the communication with code reviewers, though generally effective, could benefit from more opportunities for clarification. An experimental test run during one of the sprints was promising, indicating a potential avenue for improvement.\n\nLooking ahead, I harbor a wish for the inclusion of projects related to building online stores. Given the pivotal role of online transactions in today&#39;s world, a dedicated sprint covering the basics of developing a virtual marketplace could offer valuable insights. This addition would not only align with current industry trends but also enhance the practical applicability of the course content.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with the Tripleten Software Engineering course has been largely positive, marked by flexibility, collaboration, and real-world applicability. The program&#39;s adaptability, coupled with the dedication of tutors and the challenging yet rewarding project assessments, has equipped me with a strong foundation for a successful career in software engineering.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sam Page&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Going into Software Engineering when switching your career path can be daunting and TripleTen is aware of that. They are super helpful in starting your journey. I am a former media major and I felt like something was missing. I originally went to college for engineering but because of one bad experience I decided to switch majors. While I have a passion for media, I was missing that spark that just made everything click into place. I tried a number of different things that just didn&#39;t seem right and then I started looking at software engineering. It was a breath of fresh air after completing my first program but I was only getting so far learning by myself. There was a point where I didn&#39;t know what I knew vs what I didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t want to go back to college and waste thousands of dollars on the chance that I might go through with it. That&#39;s when I found TripleTen. It gave me the structure I needed to learn programming while also pushing me to be the best version of myself. The projects are based on real world projects and actually teach you how to problem solve and create new projects rather than just copy a project from a text book.\nI highly recommend if you are switching careers or are self-taught but need structure in your learning journey to take a look into TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Matthew Sanchez</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>When I started at Triple Ten I had not written not one line of code in my life at that point.

When I first stepped into TripleTen, there were a few things I was hunting for in a coding bootcamp.

Flexibility was my first must-have. Juggling a full-time job meant I needed a program that woul... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>d understand when I clocked in and out wasn&#39;t always going to be conventional. TripleTen, with its understanding and adaptable approach, made sure this was never a problem.

Secondly, I was searching for a strong support network. I knew cracking the code (pun intended!) wasn&#39;t going to be a piece of cake. But I also knew that with the right people to guide me and a supportive community to fall back on, I&#39;d get there. And TripleTen didn’t let me down. The tutors and the community members were absolute gems, always ready to help. I can&#39;t thank the super helpful tutors at TripleTen enough!

Lastly, I was on the lookout for relevant and up-to-date learning resources. When I first decided to learn to code, I wasn&#39;t quite sure what I was getting myself into. But a bit of research pointed me towards the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I realized this was a solid foundation for anyone wanting to dive into creating web applications with a team. And TripleTen nailed it here too, providing a course that was not just comprehensive, but bang up-to-date.

To sum up, TripleTen has been one heck of a ride! I&#39;ve come out the other side not just with coding skills, but also with the confidence to face whatever comes next in my career. A big thank you to the entire team at TripleTen. You guys rock! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michael Powers</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started as a high school math teacher for three years.

I was a little weary about data scienc... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>e because it was so rigorous and included learning AI which I assumed was beyond my ability. 

One year, and less than $8,000 later, I now have a job making over double my teacher salary. The career program in this course is also very rigorous, and will take a 2-3 weeks to get your portfolio to their standards. It does help in the long run, but I personally did not love the process. 

The projects their courses offer are from real companies giving you real work anywhere from 2000-2017. Yes, the data may be a little old, but it gives you that real world feeling. Also, every project must be approved by one of their trained professionals. If your project is not approved, they will supply you with feedback on your mistakes and where they can be found.

Every single sprint consists of theoretical pages that give you deep insight on the skill you will be achieving. After the theory, it is common that you will be asked to demonstrate that theory the old fashioned way. For example, by hand calculate the product of two matrices. After learning how to perform that skill, and why it works, then they will show you where someone programmed it so you never have to do it by hand again. This was great for understanding the terminology rather than just saying big words and putting code to it. 

Lastly, there is weekly office hours for tutors to help you on your project or sprint lessons, and there is weekly coworking sessions where students get together and try to figure out things together. It is a great community and maintains high professional status. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michael Samiotes</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I became interested in shifting to a career in technology after I was introduced to some rudimentary coding techniques related to a hobby.

Some of the sprints were more difficult than others, but I was always able to receive any necessary help from the program&#39;s tutors. I enjoyed learning about the various techniques and formulas needed to manipulate the data to find desired answers. When we used programs that I was at least somewhat familiar with, such as Excel, the lessons were still informative and useful. When we moved on to programs that I had not heard of, such as Tableau, the lessons were detailed enough that I was able to follow along without issue.

Besides resolving my difficulties completing the coursework, the TripleTen tutors were also always available to answer my questions concerning strategies and what it was like to actually work in the profession. I sent messages that were always promptly answered (except one time when the person I had messaged got the flu), and the video conference I arranged was very informative, supportive, and arranged around my schedule.

The projects at the end of each sprint were good summations of the material, which both assisted me through a real-world problem and forced me to think critically about how to solve one. When my projects were reviewed, the feedback was returned quickly, and it was generally helpful and specific. Their comments gave me useful insights into not only how to improve the general quality of my work but how to maximize the professionalism of what I was presenting and adhere to subtle industry expectations.

Since I have only recently graduated from the main BIA program, I have not yet had the opportunity to participate in one of their externships. But I look forward to receiving a task from an actual company and completing it under guidance of the TripleTen tutors. I sometimes lack confidence, and I believe this program will help me to have more faith that my newly acquired skills can successfully be translated into a career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Mirko Zlatunic</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>If you are looking for a new career in tech but want to learn in your free time and space, then this program is perfect for you.

My name is Ryan, and I am excited to share my thoughts on this program that not only shaped my technical skills but also provided a unique and flexible learning experience.

The ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>course, initially estimated at 10 months, took me about 11 months to complete. This extended duration was partly due to planned breaks that I strategically incorporated throughout the year. However, the flexibility offered by Tripleten was a key factor that allowed me to navigate through the program at my own pace.

One of the standout features of the course is its well-thought-out structure, which mirrors the real-world project management approach. The use of sprints, a concept familiar to many tech professionals, facilitates effective time management. In my current workplace, we employ a similar sprint methodology to ensure timely project completion and maintain focus. This approach at Tripleten empowered me to plan my schedule, allocate time for each two-week sprint/project, and even work ahead if possible. The allowance for working ahead and the provision of ample time for those who might struggle with specific course components contributed to a supportive and inclusive learning environment.

Having previously attempted another bootcamp, I found that Tripleten aligned better with my learning style and schedule. The collaborative nature of the course encouraged interaction with fellow learners, fostering an environment where ideas could be shared, and challenges could be collectively addressed. Making mistakes and not immediately grasping concepts was acceptable, as the program provided the necessary resources for self-correction. The exceptional tutors played a pivotal role in this regard. Their responsiveness, even during late-night hours, was a testament to their dedication. The availability of tutors, coupled with supplementary resources, proved instrumental in my success.

The projects, a significant component of the course, were rigorously assessed by proficient code reviewers. The stringent grading criteria aimed at ensuring the quality of the code. While the critiques were meticulous, they were constructive and aimed at pushing students to produce their best work. These projects, reflecting real-world scenarios, became valuable additions to my GitHub portfolio. From crafting a personal &quot;about me&quot; page to developing a small social media platform and a weather-based outfit suggestion site with user accounts, the projects showcased diverse skills applicable in the industry.

Tripleten also offered opportunities for participation in extra activities such as code jams, enhancing the understanding of core concepts. Though I, personally, couldn&#39;t take full advantage due to my full-time work commitments, I recognize the potential benefits for those able to engage in these supplementary activities.

The career review segment, yet to be fully explored by me as it initiates post-course completion, promises to be a valuable resource. This aspect involves a comprehensive review of resumes, cover letters, and a detailed discussion on effective job application strategies within the industry.

Despite the overwhelmingly positive aspects of the program, a few challenges have been encountered. The constant updates to the curriculum, while ensuring its relevance, presented a hurdle during my course. Adjusting to changes in project requirements and learning new concepts simultaneously added a layer of complexity to the learning process. Additionally, the communication with code reviewers, though generally effective, could benefit from more opportunities for clarification. An experimental test run during one of the sprints was promising, indicating a potential avenue for improvement.

Looking ahead, I harbor a wish for the inclusion of projects related to building online stores. Given the pivotal role of online transactions in today&#39;s world, a dedicated sprint covering the basics of developing a virtual marketplace could offer valuable insights. This addition would not only align with current industry trends but also enhance the practical applicability of the course content.

In conclusion, my experience with the Tripleten Software Engineering course has been largely positive, marked by flexibility, collaboration, and real-world applicability.

When I first stepped into TripleTen, there were a few things I was hunting for in a coding bootcamp.\n\nFlexibility was my first must-have. Juggling a full-time job meant I needed a program that would understand when I clocked in and out wasn't always going to be conventional. TripleTen, with its understanding and adaptable approach, made sure this was never a problem.\n\nSecondly, I was searching for a strong support network. I knew cracking the code (pun intended!) wasn't going to be a piece of cake. But I also knew that with the right people to guide me and a supportive community to fall back on, I'd get there. And TripleTen didn’t let me down. The tutors and the community members were absolute gems, always ready to help. I can't thank the super helpful tutors at TripleTen enough!\n\nLastly, I was on the lookout for relevant and up-to-date learning resources. When I first decided to learn to code, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into. But a bit of research pointed me towards the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I realized this was a solid foundation for anyone wanting to dive into creating web applications with a team. And TripleTen nailed it here too, providing a course that was not just comprehensive, but bang up-to-date.\n\nTo sum up, TripleTen has been one heck of a ride! I've come out the other side not just with coding skills, but also with the confidence to face whatever comes next in my career. A big thank you to the entire team at TripleTen. You guys rock!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Jaurigue"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"I started as a high school math teacher for three years. I attended a four year university and spent about $75,000 on my four year degree that I ended up quitting after just three years. My backup plan was computer science in some way, and I found this company. I was a little weary about data science because it was so rigorous and included learning AI which I assumed was beyond my ability. \n\nOne year, and less than $8,000 later, I now have a job making over double my teacher salary. The career program in this course is also very rigorous, and will take a 2-3 weeks to get your portfolio to their standards. It does help in the long run, but I personally did not love the process. \n\nThe projects their courses offer are from real companies giving you real work anywhere from 2000-2017. Yes, the data may be a little old, but it gives you that real world feeling. Also, every project must be approved by one of their trained professionals. If your project is not approved, they will supply you with feedback on your mistakes and where they can be found.\n\nEvery single sprint consists of theoretical pages that give you deep insight on the skill you will be achieving. After the theory, it is common that you will be asked to demonstrate that theory the old fashioned way. For example, by hand calculate the product of two matrices. After learning how to perform that skill, and why it works, then they will show you where someone programmed it so you never have to do it by hand again. This was great for understanding the terminology rather than just saying big words and putting code to it. \n\nLastly, there is weekly office hours for tutors to help you on your project or sprint lessons, and there is weekly coworking sessions where students get together and try to figure out things together. It is a great community and maintains high professional status.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Powers"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"I became interested in shifting to a career in technology after I was introduced to some rudimentary coding techniques related to a hobby. After some online research, I selected the Business Intelligence Analyst program at TripleTen for their flexible schedule, support staff, and career assistance programs. Some of the sprints were more difficult than others, but I was always able to receive any necessary help from the program's tutors. I enjoyed learning about the various techniques and formulas needed to manipulate the data to find desired answers. When we used programs that I was at least somewhat familiar with, such as Excel, the lessons were still informative and useful. When we moved on to programs that I had not heard of, such as Tableau, the lessons were detailed enough that I was able to follow along without issue.\n\nBesides resolving my difficulties completing the coursework, the TripleTen tutors were also always available to answer my questions concerning strategies and what it was like to actually work in the profession. I sent messages that were always promptly answered (except one time when the person I had messaged got the flu), and the video conference I arranged was very informative, supportive, and arranged around my schedule.\n\nThe projects at the end of each sprint were good summations of the material, which both assisted me through a real-world problem and forced me to think critically about how to solve one. When my projects were reviewed, the feedback was returned quickly, and it was generally helpful and specific. Their comments gave me useful insights into not only how to improve the general quality of my work but how to maximize the professionalism of what I was presenting and adhere to subtle industry expectations.\n\nSince I have only recently graduated from the main BIA program, I have not yet had the opportunity to participate in one of their externships. But I look forward to receiving a task from an actual company and completing it under guidance of the TripleTen tutors. I sometimes lack confidence, and I believe this program will help me to have more faith that my newly acquired skills can successfully be translated into a career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Samiotes"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"If you are looking for a new career in tech but want to learn in your free time and space, then this program is perfect for you.

My name is Ryan, and I am excited to share my thoughts on this program that not only shaped my technical skills but also provided a unique and flexible learning experience.\n\nThe course, initially estimated at 10 months, took me about 11 months to complete. This extended duration was partly due to planned breaks that I strategically incorporated throughout the year. However, the flexibility offered by Tripleten was a key factor that allowed me to navigate through the program at my own pace.\n\nOne of the standout features of the course is its well-thought-out structure, which mirrors the real-world project management approach. The use of sprints, a concept familiar to many tech professionals, facilitates effective time management. In my current workplace, we employ a similar sprint methodology to ensure timely project completion and maintain focus. This approach at Tripleten empowered me to plan my schedule, allocate time for each two-week sprint/project, and even work ahead if possible. The allowance for working ahead and the provision of ample time for those who might struggle with specific course components contributed to a supportive and inclusive learning environment.\n\nHaving previously attempted another bootcamp, I found that Tripleten aligned better with my learning style and schedule. The collaborative nature of the course encouraged interaction with fellow learners, fostering an environment where ideas could be shared, and challenges could be collectively addressed. Making mistakes and not immediately grasping concepts was acceptable, as the program provided the necessary resources for self-correction. The exceptional tutors played a pivotal role in this regard. Their responsiveness, even during late-night hours, was a testament to their dedication. The availability of tutors, coupled with supplementary resources, proved instrumental in my success.\n\nThe projects, a significant component of the course, were rigorously assessed by proficient code reviewers. The stringent grading criteria aimed at ensuring the quality of the code. While the critiques were meticulous, they were constructive and aimed at pushing students to produce their best work. These projects, reflecting real-world scenarios, became valuable additions to my GitHub portfolio. From crafting a personal \"about me\" page to developing a small social media platform and a weather-based outfit suggestion site with user accounts, the projects showcased diverse skills applicable in the industry.\n\nTripleten also offered opportunities for participation in extra activities such as code jams, enhancing the understanding of core concepts. Though I, personally, couldn't take full advantage due to my full-time work commitments, I recognize the potential benefits for those able to engage in these supplementary activities.\n\nThe career review segment, yet to be fully explored by me as it initiates post-course completion, promises to be a valuable resource. This aspect involves a comprehensive review of resumes, cover letters, and a detailed discussion on effective job application strategies within the industry.\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive aspects of the program, a few challenges have been encountered. The constant updates to the curriculum, while ensuring its relevance, presented a hurdle during my course. Adjusting to changes in project requirements and learning new concepts simultaneously added a layer of complexity to the learning process. Additionally, the communication with code reviewers, though generally effective, could benefit from more opportunities for clarification. An experimental test run during one of the sprints was promising, indicating a potential avenue for improvement.\n\nLooking ahead, I harbor a wish for the inclusion of projects related to building online stores. Given the pivotal role of online transactions in today's world, a dedicated sprint covering the basics of developing a virtual marketplace could offer valuable insights. This addition would not only align with current industry trends but also enhance the practical applicability of the course content.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with the Tripleten Software Engineering course has been largely positive, marked by flexibility, collaboration, and real-world applicability. The program's adaptability, coupled with the dedication of tutors and the challenging yet rewarding project assessments, has equipped me with a strong foundation for a successful career in software engineering.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ryan Mexin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"Going into Software Engineering when switching your career path can be daunting and TripleTen is aware of that.

The projects are based on real world projects and actually teach you how to problem solve and create new projects rather than just copy a project from a text book.\nI highly recommend if you are switching careers or are self-taught but need structure in your learning journey to take a look into TripleTen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sam Page"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
