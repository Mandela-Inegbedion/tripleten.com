Their constructive feedback and insightful suggestions have propelled my learning forward, transforming daunting challenges into opportunities for growth.Moreover, TripleTen&#39;s emphasis on real-world applications has been a game-changer for me. Rather than being confined to theoretical exercises, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work on projects that mirror the challenges and complexities of the industry. These projects not only bolstered my technical skills but also honed my ability to think critically and solve problems creatively. As I tackled datasets, wrangled with messy data, and derived actionable insights, I felt a sense of empowerment knowing that I was gaining skills directly applicable to my future career.Beyond the educational aspect, TripleTen&#39;s commitment to job placement has instilled me with confidence as I transition into the professional realm. The prospect of embarking on a new career can be daunting, but TripleTen&#39;s career support team has been a steady beacon of guidance and encouragement. From resume crafting to interview preparation, they&#39;ve equipped me with the tools and strategies needed to navigate the job market with confidence. Moreover, the network of alumni and industry connections they provide has opened doors to opportunities I never thought possible.Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that choosing TripleTen was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made for my career. From the engaging curriculum to the unwavering support, every aspect of the bootcamp has exceeded my expectations.

I decided to leap into the QA Engineering course when I was unsatisfied with my work-life balance. The TripleTen format worked well with my schedule and learning style. I have always been a hands-on learner, and TripleTen offered plenty of that! From the format of the sprints to mimic real-world workflows to the projects, every sprint to master what was learned in that sprint. Everything works well. The community that you are welcomed into on the Discord server is great. Fellow and senior students are helpful, but you also have full access to tutors and their open-door office hours. I have completed the QA Engineering part of the course and am now in the Career Acceleration part, and I am very impressed, to say the least! I have been promised career support from other programs before, so I went into this one skeptical, but after graduating and seeing the support they give you, I have full faith in finding a job to hone my skills as a QA Engineer. If you apply yourself, you have no reason not to try!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Donaver L&#39;Bert&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717185600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167492409?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69611#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m currently in the QA Engineer program, and a month away from finishing the certification! I have a background in customer service, hospitality, and visual art. I started this path because unfortunately most these jobs can be under compensated and I wanted to change that!There were two selling points when I compared Tripleten to other bootcamps.  The first being that it’s a self-paced program, which is rare for a lot of bootcamps I saw at the time.  While the program is self paced, there is still suggested deadlines embedded on their course calendar.  This is really helpful for me being a neurodivergent individual and having something to see and schedule my time around.  Also life happens! If you find yourself falling behind you have the  support of a success managers which are assigned each student from the beginning.  Earlier in the program I became very behind and had worked with my success manger and one of the coaches on how to better reorganize my time and have a different perspective on how I was approaching my studies.  I also had to change my graduation date, which again was easily worked on with the team. All and all it was a very forgiving experience that I don’t think would have happened in a more structured program. And the second being that  TripleTen’s career program supports the student post graduation for as long as needed and also will pay your tuition if you don’t find a job in the field three months after finishing the program. This is really good for those of us who are low income and genuinely can’t afford the risk of having to pay off private student loans.The course itself is geared toward changing your career and tying in any non tech work experience you’ve had in the past and making that work for you as work with the career program.  The stuff I’ve learned on that end is very practical and works with from wherever you are.  I found the team and the material to be very understanding as well on how emotionally taxing the idea of changing your field can be (hello imposter syndrome!).As for cons of the program, it may be a bit daunting a bit to get used to their discord server if you aren’t used to Discord. This where you interact with tutors, their success manager, most of the team and other students in the program you’re in.  It can seem a little disorganized but for the most part it balances out since the team is very receptive to any feedback on any part of the program.  With that said I’m really satisfied with my experiences in the program so far (even the hard parts), and look forward to this brings me in the future.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Will Hollis&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717531200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth. After a significant time weighing my options, I chose TripleTen. I found their course engaging and well-structured. I think that they really spell things out for you without holding your hand through it. It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alejo Santos&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1717963200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/660dc7ef0d40a000129dc0a7/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As someone with a background in finance but a growing interest in the vast world of data science, I found myself at a crossroads where I knew I needed to upskill to stay relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of tech and analytics.

If you are unsure what potential career in tech you may want to pursue, they have a quick quiz to introduce you to the different bootcamp programs they offer.\nThe material within the program is well formatted and full of excellent details into the different techniques and the different practices that are used in the field of tech. The projects at the end of each Sprint gives you practical experience and tasks that you might face in your future career. The program can be a challenge for those who do not have a coding background, but the tutors in the program are extremely helpful. They do an excellent job of pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answer outright. The career course that is included in this program has been amazing! Getting insights, resume tips, and career coaching is such an amazing part of this program. I feel more confident about my professional presence when it comes to applying for jobs and interviewing with potential companies. Another aspect of TripleTen is how accommodating they are for working adults who are in the program. Life happens, and sometimes you might be unable to submit one of your projects by the due date. They are more than willing to adjust things, as long as you communicate with them! From the first phone call from the admissions advisor to interacting with my success manager, everyone in this program has been so warm and welcoming. I have even recommended some of my coworkers to check out TripleTen, and they have also commented on how friendly everyone is.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jorge Norena&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719777600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I recently completed the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) bootcamp with TripleTen, and it was an incredible experience. The program equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge essential for the tech industry. Throughout the course, I received unwavering support from my success manager, Roman, and a host of dedicated tutors. The availability of resources was impressive, making the learning process smooth and efficient.One of the standout features of TripleTen is the community. The connections I made with fellow students and tutors through the TripleTen Discord channel were invaluable. Additionally, their career acceleration program provided substantial support as I prepared to transition into the tech industry.The program&#39;s value is undeniable. It&#39;s self-paced, allowing flexibility, and requires a manageable commitment of weekly learning hours to stay on track. Importantly, no prior experience is needed to enroll, making it accessible to anyone eager to dive into the tech world.Overall, I highly recommend TripleTen to anyone looking to break into the tech industry. The combination of comprehensive learning materials, supportive community, and career advancement opportunities makes it an excellent choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kyli Johnson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1720641600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/66901989cef96e31225349a8/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Coming from a background in Interior Design and wine management, the tech world seemed both exciting and intimidating. The desire to work from home led me to explore coding bootcamps. TripleTen stood out to me because they offered a money-back guarantee - if you didn’t find a job within 6 months of completing the program. A recruiter reached out to me and walked me through exactly what the program does and what to expect and even helped me in my decision to choose the Quality Assurance Engineer program.I absolutely loved this program. My success manager was always very uplifting and helped keep me on track. I was traveling more than I was working, so I had more freedom in choosing how often I would work on the readings and projects. Being able to work at my own pace was a huge relief. It was never an issue to ask for an extension or to take a break when needed. Overall, I typically dedicate about 20 hours per week.Although I never attended the tutor’s hours, I thought they were very well organized in explaining their availability. Anytime I needed help or had a question, I never had to wait long for a response on the discord channel, especially after they implemented a helpful Chatbot.What I love the most about TripleTen is the program’s focus on success over grades. There’s no pressure to be perfect; the goal is to learn and grow. Throughout the chapters, there are short quizzes and some interactive problem-solving to ensure that you understand all the knowledge you’re taking in. The feedback on projects is always constructive, pushing me to improve. I&#39;ve submitted most of my projects at least twice, but the process has always been about learning, not just getting it right the first time.Every sprint is equipped with career tips and helpful resources to help you with your LinkedIn, resume, cover letter, and interview questions! For a beginner like me, this career-focused approach is what makes TripleTen shine. I&#39;m nearing the end of my TripleTen journey, and I wholeheartedly recommend giving TripleTen a look.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Carlos Garcia&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I decided to enroll in the QA Engineering Course because I wanted to practice my skills in QA and learn more about API testing, Automation Testing and writing SQL queries. I previously have worked in QA for some gaming companies and wanted to take my skills further and also to get help with career placement as the market seems to be extremely saturated and hard to get into. \n\nI want to Start by saying that each and every sprint for the course was extremely informative and easy to go through as someone who enjoys learning at my own pace and on my own in general. The projects that you do at the end of each sprint were also really good at reiterating and practicing the skills I had learned about. Not only was the platform really good at explaining really technical subjects, but the discord community and the tutors were extremely helpful with helping out to clarify certain things and also providing additional resources I could have never found on my own. I mostly was able to complete each sprint working a few days out of the week whenever I was free and didn&#39;t feel like it was too much at any time. What&#39;s really good though is that if you happen to fall behind on completing sprints, you are given more time to complete them and also given help. \n\nWhat I also really valued with this course is the help they give you with securing a job. You are given career advice lessons at the end of each sprint and I found all the information provided to be extremely helpful. All in all it was a great experience and a really good outlet for having recently been laid off and not getting any responses from applications. I enjoyed brushing up my skills and learning new ones. And even though I had technical background already, the information is presented in a way that makes it really accessible to anyone who doesn&#39;t have a technical background at all.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;George Aktines&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;WooHoo! I&#39;m finally a Full Stack Software Engineer! And it is all thanks to Triple Ten and their amazing support staff. Triple Ten has went above and beyond my expectations. Especially with the patience and support of the tutor staff in teaching me JavaScript, which was especially difficult for me to learn. I don&#39;t come from a computer background. I come from construction and sales where my computer knowledge was limited to specialized software for construction and the Microsoft Office Suite. When something went wrong with my laptop I simply picked up the phone and called the IT department. When I found Triple Ten and realized that I could learn a new trade skill like software engineering to be able to create and maintain that software that I was using I knew I had found my new career path.  From absolutely no knowledge to building flexible fully functioning apps was a difficult but rewarding journey for me. I thoroughly enjoyed learning HTML and CSS. It was fun and it was awesome getting to design something from nothing right in front of your eyes. \nThe Tutors were absolutely on fire and on point. Especially Vishal, Kevin, Pheonix, and Max. Thank you for sticking through this with me and helping me to learn something new that will benefit not only myself but my family as well for our future. \nI would recommend Triple Ten and their programs to anyone wanting to break into the Tech Industry.\nAnother shout out to Sharahn in the Career Acceleration Program for all of her hard work and dedication to getting all of my social media, and job searching tools together and on point for a new career as a Software Engineer. Another great thing about this program is if they can&#39;t find you a job in 6 months you get your money back! It&#39;s a win- win for anyone.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/664a711bf9916e8b23ea1002/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Jerry Stanley</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>In the labyrinth of career transitions, finding the right path can feel like deciphering an intricate code.

Rather than being confined to theoretical exercises, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work on projects that mirror the challenges and complexities of the industry. These projects not only bolstered my technical skills but also honed my ability to think critically and solve problems creatively. As I tackled datasets, wrangled with messy data, and derived actionable insights, I felt a sense of empowerment knowing that I was gaining skills directly applicable to my future career.Beyond the educational aspect, TripleTen&#39;s commitment to job placement has instilled me with confidence as I transition into the professional realm. The prospect of embarking on a new career can be daunting, but TripleTen&#39;s career support team has been a steady beacon of guidance and encouragement. From resume crafting to interview preparation, they&#39;ve equipped me with the tools and strategies needed to navigate the job market with confidence. Moreover, the network of alumni and industry connections they provide has opened doors to opportunities I never thought possible.Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that choosing TripleTen was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made for my career. From the engaging curriculum to the unwavering support, every aspect of the bootcamp has exceeded my expectations. As I eagerly anticipate the next phase of my journey – transitioning into the workforce – I do so with a profound sense of gratitude for the foundation TripleTen has provided me.In conclusion, if you&#39;re considering a career in tech, particularly in the dynamic field of data science, I wholeheartedly recommend TripleTen.

I started this path because unfortunately most these jobs can be under compensated and I wanted to change that!There were two selling poi... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>nts when I compared Tripleten to other bootcamps.  The first being that it’s a self-paced program, which is rare for a lot of bootcamps I saw at the time.  While the program is self paced, there is still suggested deadlines embedded on their course calendar.  This is really helpful for me being a neurodivergent individual and having something to see and schedule my time around.  Also life happens! If you find yourself falling behind you have the  support of a success managers which are assigned each student from the beginning.  Earlier in the program I became very behind and had worked with my success manger and one of the coaches on how to better reorganize my time and have a different perspective on how I was approaching my studies.  I also had to change my graduation date, which again was easily worked on with the team. All and all it was a very forgiving experience that I don’t think would have happened in a more structured program. And the second being that  TripleTen’s career program supports the student post graduation for as long as needed and also will pay your tuition if you don’t find a job in the field three months after finishing the program. This is really good for those of us who are low income and genuinely can’t afford the risk of having to pay off private student loans.The course itself is geared toward changing your career and tying in any non tech work experience you’ve had in the past and making that work for you as work with the career program.  The stuff I’ve learned on that end is very practical and works with from wherever you are.  I found the team and the material to be very understanding as well on how emotionally taxing the idea of changing your field can be (hello imposter syndrome!).As for cons of the program, it may be a bit daunting a bit to get used to their discord server if you aren’t used to Discord. This where you interact with tutors, their success manager, most of the team and other students in the program you’re in.  It can seem a little disorganized but for the most part it balances out since the team is very receptive to any feedback on any part of the program.  With that said I’m really satisfied with my experiences in the program so far (even the hard parts), and look forward to this brings me in the future. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69611#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Will Hollis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth.

It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/660dc7ef0d40a000129dc0a7/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alejo Santos</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>As someone with a background in finance but a growing interest in the vast world of data science, I found myself at a crossroads where I knew I needed to upskill to stay relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of tech and analytics.

The material within the program is well formatted and full of excellent details into the different techniques and the different practices that are used in the field of tech. The projects at the end of each Sprint gives you practical experience and tasks that you might face in your future career. The program can be a challenge for those who do not have a coding background, but the tutors in the program are extremely helpful. They do an excellent job of pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answer outright. The career course that is included in this program has been amazing! Getting insights, resume tips, and career coaching is such an amazing part of this program. I feel more confident about my professional presence when it comes to applying for jobs and interviewing with potential companies. Another aspect of TripleTen is how accommodating they are for working adults who are in the program. Life happens, and sometimes you might be unable to submit one of your projects by the due date. They are more than willing to adjust things, as long as you communicate with them! From the first phone call from the admissions advisor to interacting with my success manager, everyone in this program has been so warm and welcoming.

A recruiter reached out to me and walked me through exactly what the program does and what to expect and even helped me in my decision to choose the Quality Assurance Engineer program.I absolutely loved this program. My success manager was always very uplifting and helped keep me on track. I was traveling more than I was working, so I had more freedom in choosing how often I would work on the readings and projects. Being able to work at my own pace was a huge relief. It was never an issue to ask for an extension or to take a break when needed. Overall, I typically dedicate about 20 hours per week.Although I never attended the tutor’s hours, I thought they were very well organized in explaining their availability. Anytime I needed help or had a question, I never had to wait long for a response on the discord channel, especially after they implemented a helpful Chatbot.What I love the most about TripleTen is the program’s focus on success over grades. There’s no pressure to be perfect; the goal is to learn and grow. Throughout the chapters, there are short quizzes and some interactive problem-solving to ensure that you understand all the knowledge you’re taking in. The feedback on projects is always constructive, pushing me to improve. I&#39;ve submitted most of my projects at least twice, but the process has always been about learning, not just getting it right the first time.Every sprint is equipped with career tips and helpful resources to help you with your LinkedIn, resume, cover letter, and interview questions! For a beginner like me, this career-focused approach is what makes TripleTen shine. I&#39;m nearing the end of my TripleTen journey, and I wholeheartedly recommend giving TripleTen a look. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Carlos Garcia</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I decided to enroll in the QA Engineering Course because I wanted to practice my skills in QA and learn more about API testing, Automation Testing and writing SQL queries.

I want to Start by saying that each and every sprint for the course was extremely informative and easy to go through as someone who enjoys learning at my own pace and on my own in general. The projects that you do at the end of each sprint were also really good at reiterating and practicing the skills I had learned about. Not only was the platform really good at explaining really technical subjects, but the discord community and the tutors were extremely helpful with helping out to clarify certain things and also providing additional resources I could have never found on my own. I mostly was able to complete each sprint working a few days out of the week whenever I was free and didn&#39;t feel like it was too much at any time. What&#39;s really good though is that if you happen to fall behind on completing sprints, you are given more time to complete them and also given help. 

What I also really valued with this course is the help they give you with securing a job. You are given career advice lessons at the end of each sprint and I found all the information provided to be extremely helpful. All in all it was a great experience and a really good outlet for having recently been laid off and not getting any responses from applications. I enjoyed brushing up my skills and learning new ones. And even though I had technical background already, the information is presented in a way that makes it really accessible to anyone who doesn&#39;t have a technical background at all. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>George Aktines</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>WooHoo!

I don&#39;t come from a computer background. I come from construction and sales where my computer knowledge was limited to specialized software for construction and the Microsoft Office Suite. When something went wrong with my laptop I simply picked up the phone and called the IT department. When I found Triple Ten and realized that I could learn a new trade skill like software engineering to be able to create and maintain that software that I was using I knew I had found my new career path.  From absolutely no knowledge to building flexible fully functioning apps was a difficult but rewarding journey for me. I thoroughly enjoyed learning HTML and CSS. It was fun and it was awesome getting to design something from nothing right in front of your eyes. 
The Tutors were absolutely on fire and on point. Especially Vishal, Kevin, Pheonix, and Max. Thank you for sticking through this with me and helping me to learn something new that will benefit not only myself but my family as well for our future. 
I would recommend Triple Ten and their programs to anyone wanting to break into the Tech Industry.
Another shout out to Sharahn in the Career Acceleration Program for all of her hard work and dedication to getting all of my social media, and job searching tools together and on point for a new career as a Software Engineer. Another great thing about this program is if they can&#39;t find you a job in 6 months you get your money back! It&#39;s a win- win for anyone. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>3</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>4</span></a><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>5</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-05-18T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"In the labyrinth of career transitions, finding the right path can feel like deciphering an intricate code. For years, I wandered through various professions, feeling a magnetic pull towards the world of computers and data. Finally, fueled by a passion for numbers and a desire for remote work opportunities, I embarked on a journey into the realm of data science.

Through interactive modules, coding challenges, and real-world projects, I found myself not just understanding the concepts but actually applying them in meaningful ways. This hands-on approach not only solidified my understanding but also ignited a sense of excitement and curiosity within me.Central to my positive experience with TripleTen has been the support network they've cultivated. The project reviewers and tutors, with their expertise and guidance, have been invaluable allies in my journey. Whether I hit a roadblock in my coding endeavors or grappled with complex statistical concepts, I always found assistance just a click away. Their constructive feedback and insightful suggestions have propelled my learning forward, transforming daunting challenges into opportunities for growth.Moreover, TripleTen's emphasis on real-world applications has been a game-changer for me. Rather than being confined to theoretical exercises, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that mirror the challenges and complexities of the industry. These projects not only bolstered my technical skills but also honed my ability to think critically and solve problems creatively. As I tackled datasets, wrangled with messy data, and derived actionable insights, I felt a sense of empowerment knowing that I was gaining skills directly applicable to my future career.Beyond the educational aspect, TripleTen's commitment to job placement has instilled me with confidence as I transition into the professional realm. The prospect of embarking on a new career can be daunting, but TripleTen's career support team has been a steady beacon of guidance and encouragement. From resume crafting to interview preparation, they've equipped me with the tools and strategies needed to navigate the job market with confidence. Moreover, the network of alumni and industry connections they provide has opened doors to opportunities I never thought possible.Reflecting on my journey thus far, I can confidently say that choosing TripleTen was one of the best decisions I've made for my career. From the engaging curriculum to the unwavering support, every aspect of the bootcamp has exceeded my expectations.

I decided to leap into the QA Engineering course when I was unsatisfied with my work-life balance. The TripleTen format worked well with my schedule and learning style. I have always been a hands-on learner, and TripleTen offered plenty of that! From the format of the sprints to mimic real-world workflows to the projects, every sprint to master what was learned in that sprint. Everything works well. The community that you are welcomed into on the Discord server is great. Fellow and senior students are helpful, but you also have full access to tutors and their open-door office hours. I have completed the QA Engineering part of the course and am now in the Career Acceleration part, and I am very impressed, to say the least! I have been promised career support from other programs before, so I went into this one skeptical, but after graduating and seeing the support they give you, I have full faith in finding a job to hone my skills as a QA Engineer.

I have a background in customer service, hospitality, and visual art. I started this path because unfortunately most these jobs can be under compensated and I wanted to change that!There were two selling points when I compared Tripleten to other bootcamps.  The first being that it’s a self-paced program, which is rare for a lot of bootcamps I saw at the time.  While the program is self paced, there is still suggested deadlines embedded on their course calendar.  This is really helpful for me being a neurodivergent individual and having something to see and schedule my time around.  Also life happens! If you find yourself falling behind you have the  support of a success managers which are assigned each student from the beginning.  Earlier in the program I became very behind and had worked with my success manger and one of the coaches on how to better reorganize my time and have a different perspective on how I was approaching my studies.  I also had to change my graduation date, which again was easily worked on with the team. All and all it was a very forgiving experience that I don’t think would have happened in a more structured program. And the second being that  TripleTen’s career program supports the student post graduation for as long as needed and also will pay your tuition if you don’t find a job in the field three months after finishing the program. This is really good for those of us who are low income and genuinely can’t afford the risk of having to pay off private student loans.The course itself is geared toward changing your career and tying in any non tech work experience you’ve had in the past and making that work for you as work with the career program.  The stuff I’ve learned on that end is very practical and works with from wherever you are.  I found the team and the material to be very understanding as well on how emotionally taxing the idea of changing your field can be (hello imposter syndrome!).As for cons of the program, it may be a bit daunting a bit to get used to their discord server if you aren’t used to Discord. This where you interact with tutors, their success manager, most of the team and other students in the program you’re in.  It can seem a little disorganized but for the most part it balances out since the team is very receptive to any feedback on any part of the program.  With that said I’m really satisfied with my experiences in the program so far (even the hard parts), and look forward to this brings me in the future.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Donaver L'Bert"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-04T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I signed up for TripleTen because I wanted to leave the healthcare field and get into something more remote and more fulfilling for my personal growth. After a significant time weighing my options, I chose TripleTen. I found their course engaging and well-structured. I think that they really spell things out for you without holding your hand through it. It is only for the self-driven but I still think that they are forgiving with their due dates and allow you to take some time off if you need it. Also, their facility is fantastic and their tutors are really nice and helpful. My experience with Triple Ten was excellent. They helped guide me into the world of data analysis. I started with Excel/Google Sheets, went into SQL, then Tableau, and finally PowerBi. It is an excellent certification to have and I am quite happy about my education at this organization. The only minor complaint I have is about the nature of online work itself, when you get lost it can sometimes take a long time to get back on track. TripleTen does the best that it can with their Discord and their quick communication to help you through a problem. Unfortunately though, there were occasionally times where I would not be able to figure out an issue and it would take a day or so to figure it out just because of the nature of figuring things out over Discord chat or looking up other Discord chats to help work through an issue. This is not an issue that falls on TripleTen, this is just how remote learning is, so be prepared for that when you sign up for this course. Overall though, I had no issues with their service and am glad I chose them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Will Hollis"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-09T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As someone with a background in finance but a growing interest in the vast world of data science, I found myself at a crossroads where I knew I needed to upskill to stay relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of tech and analytics. After extensive research, I landed on TripleTen as the platform to kickstart my journey into data science. Why TripleTen:I chose TripleTen primarily because of its reputation for providing a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience. The testimonials from past students and the detailed curriculum were major factors in my decision-making process.

When I came across TripleTen during my search, I looked into the pricing, the time commitment, and the job success rate for their graduates. There were a lot of amazing reviews and success stories during my research into TripleTen. If you are unsure what potential career in tech you may want to pursue, they have a quick quiz to introduce you to the different bootcamp programs they offer.\nThe material within the program is well formatted and full of excellent details into the different techniques and the different practices that are used in the field of tech. The projects at the end of each Sprint gives you practical experience and tasks that you might face in your future career. The program can be a challenge for those who do not have a coding background, but the tutors in the program are extremely helpful. They do an excellent job of pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answer outright. The career course that is included in this program has been amazing! Getting insights, resume tips, and career coaching is such an amazing part of this program. I feel more confident about my professional presence when it comes to applying for jobs and interviewing with potential companies. Another aspect of TripleTen is how accommodating they are for working adults who are in the program. Life happens, and sometimes you might be unable to submit one of your projects by the due date. They are more than willing to adjust things, as long as you communicate with them! From the first phone call from the admissions advisor to interacting with my success manager, everyone in this program has been so warm and welcoming. I have even recommended some of my coworkers to check out TripleTen, and they have also commented on how friendly everyone is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacqueline Hill"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I recently completed the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) bootcamp with TripleTen, and it was an incredible experience.

The desire to work from home led me to explore coding bootcamps. TripleTen stood out to me because they offered a money-back guarantee - if you didn’t find a job within 6 months of completing the program. A recruiter reached out to me and walked me through exactly what the program does and what to expect and even helped me in my decision to choose the Quality Assurance Engineer program.I absolutely loved this program. My success manager was always very uplifting and helped keep me on track. I was traveling more than I was working, so I had more freedom in choosing how often I would work on the readings and projects. Being able to work at my own pace was a huge relief. It was never an issue to ask for an extension or to take a break when needed. Overall, I typically dedicate about 20 hours per week.Although I never attended the tutor’s hours, I thought they were very well organized in explaining their availability. Anytime I needed help or had a question, I never had to wait long for a response on the discord channel, especially after they implemented a helpful Chatbot.What I love the most about TripleTen is the program’s focus on success over grades. There’s no pressure to be perfect; the goal is to learn and grow. Throughout the chapters, there are short quizzes and some interactive problem-solving to ensure that you understand all the knowledge you’re taking in. The feedback on projects is always constructive, pushing me to improve. I've submitted most of my projects at least twice, but the process has always been about learning, not just getting it right the first time.Every sprint is equipped with career tips and helpful resources to help you with your LinkedIn, resume, cover letter, and interview questions! For a beginner like me, this career-focused approach is what makes TripleTen shine. I'm nearing the end of my TripleTen journey, and I wholeheartedly recommend giving TripleTen a look.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyli Johnson"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"I decided to enroll in the QA Engineering Course because I wanted to practice my skills in QA and learn more about API testing, Automation Testing and writing SQL queries. I previously have worked in QA for some gaming companies and wanted to take my skills further and also to get help with career placement as the market seems to be extremely saturated and hard to get into. \n\nI want to Start by saying that each and every sprint for the course was extremely informative and easy to go through as someone who enjoys learning at my own pace and on my own in general. The projects that you do at the end of each sprint were also really good at reiterating and practicing the skills I had learned about. Not only was the platform really good at explaining really technical subjects, but the discord community and the tutors were extremely helpful with helping out to clarify certain things and also providing additional resources I could have never found on my own. I mostly was able to complete each sprint working a few days out of the week whenever I was free and didn't feel like it was too much at any time. What's really good though is that if you happen to fall behind on completing sprints, you are given more time to complete them and also given help. \n\nWhat I also really valued with this course is the help they give you with securing a job. You are given career advice lessons at the end of each sprint and I found all the information provided to be extremely helpful. All in all it was a great experience and a really good outlet for having recently been laid off and not getting any responses from applications. I enjoyed brushing up my skills and learning new ones. And even though I had technical background already, the information is presented in a way that makes it really accessible to anyone who doesn't have a technical background at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carlos Garcia"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"WooHoo! I'm finally a Full Stack Software Engineer! And it is all thanks to Triple Ten and their amazing support staff. Triple Ten has went above and beyond my expectations. Especially with the patience and support of the tutor staff in teaching me JavaScript, which was especially difficult for me to learn. I don't come from a computer background. I come from construction and sales where my computer knowledge was limited to specialized software for construction and the Microsoft Office Suite. When something went wrong with my laptop I simply picked up the phone and called the IT department. When I found Triple Ten and realized that I could learn a new trade skill like software engineering to be able to create and maintain that software that I was using I knew I had found my new career path.  From absolutely no knowledge to building flexible fully functioning apps was a difficult but rewarding journey for me. I thoroughly enjoyed learning HTML and CSS. It was fun and it was awesome getting to design something from nothing right in front of your eyes. \nThe Tutors were absolutely on fire and on point. Especially Vishal, Kevin, Pheonix, and Max. Thank you for sticking through this with me and helping me to learn something new that will benefit not only myself but my family as well for our future. \nI would recommend Triple Ten and their programs to anyone wanting to break into the Tech Industry.\nAnother shout out to Sharahn in the Career Acceleration Program for all of her hard work and dedication to getting all of my social media, and job searching tools together and on point for a new career as a Software Engineer. Another great thing about this program is if they can't find you a job in 6 months you get your money back! It's a win- win for anyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"George Aktines"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
