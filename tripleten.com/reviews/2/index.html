The curriculum covers the MERN stack in enough detail to help you become proficient in each technology and the projects they have you do are a step (or two) above those you&#39;ll find in a lot of other bootcamps. They just look more professional, they are well thought out, and you spend enough time on them to make them both fully-functional and polished. No hastily put-together, poorly designed projects here. Also, the entire team is so caring and thoughtful, and are willing to help in any way they can. They really make the program feel personal.Having completed the web dev course, I feel I have all the skills to be a React Developer, FrontEnd Dev, or Web Developer, and have already had several interviews this month. I will say though, if you truly want to succeed, you still need to put in work outside the class. You need to practice coding and make more projects, create a portfolio, and apply to a ton of jobs. This is not a golden ticket in the tech industry, but it is a very effective guiding hand into a new career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alesa Weiss&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1705003200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66126#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After moving to a new state and leaving a decade-long position, I found myself with the opportunity to completely change my career. I did some research, looking online for online courses, certificates, or trainings and stumbled upon tech bootcamps! Throughout all of the noise, TripleTen (Practicum at the time) kept jumping out at me; mostly because of the friendly and streamlined graphics and marketing, but also because they made it seem possible more than the others. With two kids under 5 at home and my husband working 6 days a week, I knew I had to find something flexible, and TripleTen seemed to be the right fit! I scheduled a call with a sales person and he called me almost immediately, even though he was on an airplane traveling to see his daughter for her wedding dress fitting! He was super personable and allowed me to ask dumb questions, explaining the answers to them all. He also asked me, \&quot;What&#39;s your why?\&quot; and I immediately realized that not only was I making this career change for myself, but also to secure a future for my family. Solid salaries, flexible working conditions, and a secure job market were all reasons I wanted to make this switch. And since then, nothing has changed! I started with the Software Engineer program and although it was really fun and sparked my creative side, I was worried that I couldn&#39;t see myself doing it forever, so I asked my sales rep if I could switch to QA and he made it happen! The QA program was definitely a better fit for how my brain works - I don&#39;t necessarily want to design a website, but if you do and you want me to help you make sure it works they way you wanted, I&#39;m your gal. The platform is fantastic! It&#39;s user-friendly, simple, and the lessons are straightforward. The projects require some determination and sometimes outside studying, but tutors and instructors are always available to help when you reach out. The community of students on Discord are also extremely helpful and encouraging.  I even found a study group of fellow students who were all in a different sprint than me, but it was so lovely to be able to talk about the topics I was learning with someone who spoke the same \&quot;language.\&quot; And while I haven&#39;t done the accelerated career program yet (one project left!), I have really valued the career advice throughout the sprints. I even used a LinkedIn message template from TripleTen to secure my current position! My boss was very impressed at mentions it often. That being said, the program requires determination and it&#39;s definitely not easy! You will need to take notes, study hard, and maybe even re-read through some lessons. Basically, what you put into the course is what you get out of it. Although it is a good deal (try to get in on one of the sales), it isn&#39;t free, so make sure you give it your all so that you get everything you can!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheldon Kinsler&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707595200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66822#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As someone who is currently working in sales, I&#39;ve never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an awesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I&#39;ve always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.\nI started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night&#39;s sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I&#39;m a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.\nThe lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you&#39;re doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It&#39;s honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don&#39;t get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it&#39;s so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.\nBuilt into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven&#39;t quite finished yet, I still feel like I&#39;m ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I&#39;m super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It&#39;s super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I&#39;ve been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that&#39;s super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I&#39;m in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you&#39;re definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn&#39;t much you can&#39;t do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It&#39;s definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can&#39;t effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I&#39;m almost through the course and I&#39;m so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tina Loo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1707940800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66947#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they&#39;re not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation. Their program is very interactive and intuitive and the tutors are always available on discord should you need any help. They have weekly coworking sessions that you can attend to speak directly with the tutors and go over any questions/concerns you may have. You&#39;re also assigned a success manager at the beginning who&#39;ll be your go-to contact person should you need any assistance. I found their system to be very well organized and never felt like I didn&#39;t know who to reach out to if I needed anything and was able to finish the program 1 month early!I was happy to learn a new skill set and am currently enrolled in their career acceleration program after finishing the course, thus I cannot really review the job assistance part of it yet, but am really looking forward to hopefully landing a new job in a new career field.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sayvon Edmondson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710014400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92755847?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67569#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I began learning how to code on my own, with the pursuit of starting a tech business. When I began learning JavaScript I just didn&#39;t know what I was doing and if whether or not I was doing it right. I lacked a feedback loop and a reviewer to give me information on whether or not my code was best practice or not. I chose TripleTen not just because you could pay partial up front and then you don&#39;t have to pay again until you find your first job. I chose them because of the curriculum, I enjoyed the idea of being so proficient in the language that gave me such a hard time as a self learner, that I could use it for Frontend and Backend using Node.js. The TripleTen path was for me the quickest route to obtaining the skills that I needed to reach my goal. I spend roughly 30+ hours per week on the platform going through the sprints which are created in a way to bring you from no knowledge up to a Software Engineer! My favorite activities within TripleTen is participating within their neat independent coding challenges, as well as taking advantage of the 1 to 1 tutor Office hours. TripleTen has helped me feel more confident in my ability to code in general. They&#39;ve helped me refine the knowledge I came in with (which looking back on it was very little!) as well as expand my view on everything else that comes with being a Software Engineer not just coding, other important factors like networking and resume advice. For those of you who are thinking this of this oppurtunity as something you missed out on/too late for you start, or it being to risky. I have a quote for you that helps me make decisions, \&quot;Most people tip toe through life, hoping they make it safely to death.\&quot; -Earl Nightingale. Thinking about it like that you realize it&#39;s a losing game, you only have one life make the most of it! Useful tips for those of you who are starting your journey. There will be times where you struggle embrace those times that&#39;s where the learning happens, feeling frustrated is completely normal and taking breaks away from it is extemely recommended. For me when I encounter a problem I try and figure it out. If I&#39;ve tried everything I take a break, go on a walk, read, garden do anything then come back to it usually thats the answer to majority of your problems. If you still are encountering problems then talk with your tutors! They are very knowledgable and will guide you in a way where that caliber of problem won&#39;t give you such a hard time the next time you recieve it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Natalie&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710273600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve been working in data analytics for over 7 years, but lacked advanced analytics/data science skill sets. I knew I had this skill gap, but was always overwhelmed by ~*how*~ I should learn these skills in a comprehensive and informed way on my own. There are so many resources out there that it&#39;s overwhelming.Unfortunately, my role was impacted by tech layoffs and I decided now was a great time to invest in myself and build these skills. As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you&#39;d like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen&#39;s program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I&#39;m truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can&#39;t recommend it more highly.If you&#39;re on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Alberniz Garcia Minaya&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710360000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67638#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I ran into an Add on IG about 6 - 7 months ago right when I was thinking on doing a career change. What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the program and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn&#39;t get a Job I&#39;d get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn&#39;t find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there&#39;s always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I&#39;m a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, \&quot;Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this\&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don&#39;t know something or are not experts on something doesn&#39;t mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don&#39;t let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don&#39;t be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Parker Shyu&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710446400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far! I have been transitioning into the tech industry for the past 3 years, and have been struggling to get my foot in the door. My previous experience entails a UX/UI Design bootcamp, a year long software contract that got terminated due to a hiring freeze in the company, and a training in Full Stack Development, along with some tangential learning on side platforms like Codecademy and Leetcode. As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I&#39;ll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different \&quot;Sprints\&quot; (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don&#39;t have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what&#39;s called a \&quot;cohort,\&quot; so that our \&quot;two-week sprint\&quot; schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that&#39;s more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to \&quot;office hours\&quot; where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I&#39;ll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can&#39;t wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Heather N Looby Bennett&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience! Not only am I learning about a field I have no experience in, I am gaining confidence in the field and readying myself for the next chapter in my career. I decided to study with Tripleten because it was the first bootcamp I felt excited about. The counselors took time to explain the programs and consult on the best program for me so I am very confident in my decision! I am an older student (almost 50) but the coursework is explained in a way that is perfect for those without much coding experience. I was apprehensive at first but am now confident in my ability to learn coding and analytics. TripleTen has given me the knowledge and confidence to work in the exciting field of data!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Travis Sutton&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711051200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138404337?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67882#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,50],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;At 35 years old, I decided to change my path in life and pursue software engineering, as I&#39;ve always loved computers and I wanted to have a career in tech.I began searching around trying to decide between a traditional university route or try out one of the online bootcamps I saw for programming. I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into it. After reading a ton of positive reviews I decided to take the first step and reach out to an advisor. I thought I was going to get some sort of automated system or something else, but I got a call from an actual real human being, Oscar, who was super nice, helpful, and not pushy at all. After the call I decided to give TripleTen a go.I chose the software engineering program because I felt that gave me a good chance at a great career with a good work / life balance, and I wanted to learn how to build websites.I can&#39;t say enough how much the tutors and community managers absolutely make the program amazing. I don&#39;t feel at all like a customer, I feel like a student, and whenever I need help I can get it. The discord is also very active and gives you the opportunity to talk to other students as well as tutors.The program is split between theory and projects. The theory contains tasks and problems to work through as well as quizzes to help you learn the material. The projects are real life websites that you get to build and keep in your portfolio and are an amazing way to actually apply what you&#39;re learning, and they get more advanced as you go!You also get access to career coaches that answer your questions, and can be a great resource for chatting with someone in the industry. Most of the tutors are actual software engineers with real jobs so you have the chance to gain insight from them as well.Along with that, they have all sorts of resources to take advantage of like seminars about the industry, important changes and information and really a lot more. You can study with other students or take part in challenges, watch videos on tech, and they even have an off topic section on discord where people just post thoughts and funny stuff which really makes it feel like an actual community.One of the best parts is there is technically no set schedule, the office hours (time with tutors) are scheduled, but they have them spread throughout the day so chances are you will be able to attend at least some of them, and they give you enough time to complete your projects. You can also schedule a 1 on 1 time with a tutor if needed.The program is not a free certificate either, you really learn and you learn a lot. It&#39;s very in depth and I would say be ready to devote real effort to complete it, because they&#39;re really trying to prepare you for a real world job where you need technical programming skills. I typically put in 20-30 hours a week into the program, but it doesn&#39;t feel overwhelming.Overall, I would 10 out of 10 recommend TripleTen to someone looking to get into programming and the tech industry, I feel lucky that this is the program I went with.

They just look more professional, they are well thought out, and you spend enough time on them to make them both fully-functional and polished. No hastily put-together, poorly designed projects here. Also, the entire team is so caring and thoughtful, and are willing to help in any way they can. They really make the program feel personal.Having completed the web dev course, I feel I have all the skills to be a React Developer, FrontEnd Dev, or Web Developer, and have already had several interviews this month. I will say though, if you truly want to succeed, you still need to put in work outside the class. You need to practice coding and make more projects, create a portfolio, and apply to a ton of jobs. This is not a golden ticket in the tech industry, but it is a very effective guiding hand into a new career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=32221#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alesa Weiss</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Quality Assurance</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>After moving to a new state and leaving a decade-long position, I found myself with the opportunity to completely change my career.

With two kids under 5 at home and my husband working 6 days a week, I knew I had to find something flexible, and TripleTen seemed to be the right fit! I scheduled a call with a sales person and he called me almost immediately, even though he was on an airplane traveling to see his daughter for her wedding dress fitting! He was super personable and allowed me to ask dumb questions, explaining the answers to them all. He also asked me, &quot;What&#39;s your why?&quot; and I immediately realized that not only was I making this career change for myself, but also to secure a future for my family. Solid salaries, flexible working conditions, and a secure job market were all reasons I wanted to make this switch. And since then, nothing has changed! I started with the Software Engineer program and although it was really fun and sparked my creative side, I was worried that I couldn&#39;t see myself doing it forever, so I asked my sales rep if I could switch to QA and he made it happen! The QA program was definitely a better fit for how my brain works - I don&#39;t necessarily want to design a website, but if you do and you want me to help you make sure it works they way you wanted, I&#39;m your gal. The platform is fantastic! It&#39;s user-friendly, simple, and the lessons are straightforward. The projects require some determination and sometimes outside studying, but tutors and instructors are always available to help when you reach out. The community of students on Discord are also extremely helpful and encouraging.  I even found a study group of fellow students who were all in a different sprint than me, but it was so lovely to be able to talk about the topics I was learning with someone who spoke the same &quot;language.&quot; And while I haven&#39;t done the accelerated career program yet (one project left!), I have really valued the career advice throughout the sprints. I even used a LinkedIn message template from TripleTen to secure my current position! My boss was very impressed at mentions it often. That being said, the program requires determination and it&#39;s definitely not easy! You will need to take notes, study hard, and maybe even re-read through some lessons. Basically, what you put into the course is what you get out of it. Although it is a good deal (try to get in on one of the sales), it isn&#39;t free, so make sure you give it your all so that you get everything you can! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66126#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sheldon Kinsler</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>As someone who is currently working in sales, I&#39;ve never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an a... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>wesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I&#39;ve always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.
I started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night&#39;s sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I&#39;m a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.
The lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you&#39;re doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It&#39;s honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don&#39;t get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it&#39;s so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.
Built into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven&#39;t quite finished yet, I still feel like I&#39;m ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I&#39;m super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It&#39;s super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I&#39;ve been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that&#39;s super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I&#39;m in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you&#39;re definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn&#39;t much you can&#39;t do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It&#39;s definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can&#39;t effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I&#39;m almost through the course and I&#39;m so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=66822#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tina Loo</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they&#39;re not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation.

I chose TripleTen not just because you could pay partial up front and then you don&#39;t have to pay again until you find your first job. I chose them because of the curriculum, I enjoyed the idea of being so proficient in the language that gave me such a hard time as a self learner, that I could use it for Frontend and Backend using Node.js. The TripleTen path was for me the quickest route to obtaining the skills that I needed to reach my goal. I spend roughly 30+ hours per week on the platform going through the sprints which are created in a way to bring you from no knowledge up to a Software Engineer! My favorite activities within TripleTen is participating within their neat independent coding challenges, as well as taking advantage of the 1 to 1 tutor Office hours. TripleTen has helped me feel more confident in my ability to code in general. They&#39;ve helped me refine the knowledge I came in with (which looking back on it was very little!) as well as expand my view on everything else that comes with being a Software Engineer not just coding, other important factors like networking and resume advice. For those of you who are thinking this of this oppurtunity as something you missed out on/too late for you start, or it being to risky. I have a quote for you that helps me make decisions, &quot;Most people tip toe through life, hoping they make it safely to death.&quot; -Earl Nightingale. Thinking about it like that you realize it&#39;s a losing game, you only have one life make the most of it! Useful tips for those of you who are starting your journey. There will be times where you struggle embrace those times that&#39;s where the learning happens, feeling frustrated is completely normal and taking breaks away from it is extemely recommended. For me when I encounter a problem I try and figure it out. If I&#39;ve tried everything I take a break, go on a walk, read, garden do anything then come back to it usually thats the answer to majority of your problems. If you still are encountering problems then talk with your tutors! They are very knowledgable and will guide you in a way where that caliber of problem won&#39;t give you such a hard time the next time you recieve it. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67569#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Natalie</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ve been working in data analytics for over 7 years, but lacked advanced analytics/data science skill sets.

As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you&#39;d like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen&#39;s program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I&#39;m truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can&#39;t recommend it more highly.If you&#39;re on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alberniz Garcia Minaya</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I ran into an Add on IG about 6 - 7 months ago right when I was thinking on doing a career change. What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the pr... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ogram and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn&#39;t get a Job I&#39;d get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn&#39;t find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there&#39;s always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I&#39;m a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, &quot;Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don&#39;t know something or are not experts on something doesn&#39;t mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don&#39;t let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don&#39;t be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67638#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Parker Shyu</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far! I have been transitioning into the tech industry for the past 3 years, and have been struggling to get my foot in the door. My previous experience entails a UX/UI Design bootcamp, a year long software contra... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ct that got terminated due to a hiring freeze in the company, and a training in Full Stack Development, along with some tangential learning on side platforms like Codecademy and Leetcode. As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I&#39;ll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different &quot;Sprints&quot; (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don&#39;t have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what&#39;s called a &quot;cohort,&quot; so that our &quot;two-week sprint&quot; schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that&#39;s more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to &quot;office hours&quot; where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I&#39;ll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can&#39;t wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Heather N Looby Bennett</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Business Intelligence Analytics</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience!

I ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into it. After reading a ton of positive reviews I decided to take the first step and reach out to an advisor. I thought I was going to get some sort of automated system or something else, but I got a call from an actual real human being, Oscar, who was super nice, helpful, and not pushy at all. After the call I decided to give TripleTen a go.I chose the software engineering program because I felt that gave me a good chance at a great career with a good work / life balance, and I wanted to learn how to build websites.I can&#39;t say enough how much the tutors and community managers absolutely make the program amazing. I don&#39;t feel at all like a customer, I feel like a student, and whenever I need help I can get it. The discord is also very active and gives you the opportunity to talk to other students as well as tutors.The program is split between theory and projects. The theory contains tasks and problems to work through as well as quizzes to help you learn the material. The projects are real life websites that you get to build and keep in your portfolio and are an amazing way to actually apply what you&#39;re learning, and they get more advanced as you go!You also get access to career coaches that answer your questions, and can be a great resource for chatting with someone in the industry. Most of the tutors are actual software engineers with real jobs so you have the chance to gain insight from them as well.Along with that, they have all sorts of resources to take advantage of like seminars about the industry, important changes and information and really a lot more. You can study with other students or take part in challenges, watch videos on tech, and they even have an off topic section on discord where people just post thoughts and funny stuff which really makes it feel like an actual community.One of the best parts is there is technically no set schedule, the office hours (time with tutors) are scheduled, but they have them spread throughout the day so chances are you will be able to attend at least some of them, and they give you enough time to complete your projects. You can also schedule a 1 on 1 time with a tutor if needed.The program is not a free certificate either, you really learn and you learn a lot. It&#39;s very in depth and I would say be ready to devote real effort to complete it, because they&#39;re really trying to prepare you for a real world job where you need technical programming skills. I typically put in 20-30 hours a week into the program, but it doesn&#39;t feel overwhelming.Overall, I would 10 out of 10 recommend TripleTen to someone looking to get into programming and the tech industry, I feel lucky that this is the program I went with. Looking forward to graduate this year! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67882#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../index.html#reviews" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../software-engineering/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><!----><!----><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>1</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>2</span></a><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>3</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../35/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>35</a><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2021-02-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"While its possible to find all the information you would need to know on the internet (Udemy, Coursera, Youtube), bootcamps like this are for those who would prefer a little more structure and guidance. The curriculum covers the MERN stack in enough detail to help you become proficient in each technology and the projects they have you do are a step (or two) above those you'll find in a lot of other bootcamps. They just look more professional, they are well thought out, and you spend enough time on them to make them both fully-functional and polished. No hastily put-together, poorly designed projects here. Also, the entire team is so caring and thoughtful, and are willing to help in any way they can. They really make the program feel personal.Having completed the web dev course, I feel I have all the skills to be a React Developer, FrontEnd Dev, or Web Developer, and have already had several interviews this month. I will say though, if you truly want to succeed, you still need to put in work outside the class. You need to practice coding and make more projects, create a portfolio, and apply to a ton of jobs. This is not a golden ticket in the tech industry, but it is a very effective guiding hand into a new career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Schutte"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Quality Assurance","description":"5-month part-time online program for beginners","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P5M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"After moving to a new state and leaving a decade-long position, I found myself with the opportunity to completely change my career. I did some research, looking online for online courses, certificates, or trainings and stumbled upon tech bootcamps! Throughout all of the noise, TripleTen (Practicum at the time) kept jumping out at me; mostly because of the friendly and streamlined graphics and marketing, but also because they made it seem possible more than the others. With two kids under 5 at home and my husband working 6 days a week, I knew I had to find something flexible, and TripleTen seemed to be the right fit! I scheduled a call with a sales person and he called me almost immediately, even though he was on an airplane traveling to see his daughter for her wedding dress fitting! He was super personable and allowed me to ask dumb questions, explaining the answers to them all. He also asked me, \"What's your why?\" and I immediately realized that not only was I making this career change for myself, but also to secure a future for my family. Solid salaries, flexible working conditions, and a secure job market were all reasons I wanted to make this switch. And since then, nothing has changed! I started with the Software Engineer program and although it was really fun and sparked my creative side, I was worried that I couldn't see myself doing it forever, so I asked my sales rep if I could switch to QA and he made it happen! The QA program was definitely a better fit for how my brain works - I don't necessarily want to design a website, but if you do and you want me to help you make sure it works they way you wanted, I'm your gal. The platform is fantastic! It's user-friendly, simple, and the lessons are straightforward. The projects require some determination and sometimes outside studying, but tutors and instructors are always available to help when you reach out. The community of students on Discord are also extremely helpful and encouraging.  I even found a study group of fellow students who were all in a different sprint than me, but it was so lovely to be able to talk about the topics I was learning with someone who spoke the same \"language.\" And while I haven't done the accelerated career program yet (one project left!), I have really valued the career advice throughout the sprints. I even used a LinkedIn message template from TripleTen to secure my current position! My boss was very impressed at mentions it often. That being said, the program requires determination and it's definitely not easy! You will need to take notes, study hard, and maybe even re-read through some lessons. Basically, what you put into the course is what you get out of it. Although it is a good deal (try to get in on one of the sales), it isn't free, so make sure you give it your all so that you get everything you can!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alesa Weiss"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As someone who is currently working in sales, I've never really thought of working in tech before. I saw a random funny reel on Instagram one day about working in tech and decided to click on it to learn more and see what it was. It was from someone who worked in coding and seemed like they had an awesome job and remote life. They talked about TripleTen so I checked it out and started reading reviews and learning more about it. There are so many different options and courses with TripleTen they really have something for everyone. I decided to talk with one of the advisors just to learn more and see what it was about. She explained all of the different courses and programs to me and helped me figure out that I was really interested in the Business Intelligence Analytics program. I've always had an entrepreneurial mind and even majored in entrepreneurship in college so I love helping businesses grow but learning how to use data and tech to improve businesses was a great way to keep up with the way the world is going with tech and data. The school payment options made everything super easy and all of the tutors and staff made signing up a breeze.\nI started pretty soon after and got right into it. I still have a day job and this fits perfectly into my schedule. I usually study after work for about 2 hours a day during week days and then usually around 4 hours a day on the weekends if I can. I always have time to do other things in life as well so I can still go to the gym, be with my family, go out to eat, and get a solid night's sleep. Since the courses are go-at-your-own-pace, you can go however fast or slow you would like. Even with just doing what I currently am, I'm a month ahead of schedule. This gives me time to work on projects and lessons.\nThe lessons are well-structured and include real-life examples that really help me understand. There are occasionally things that are confusing, but I reread everything and really backtrack to make sure I can fully understand it. One piece of advice I would definitely give is to take really good notes. This way, when you're doing the projects or need to review something, you can easily see it again. The projects really put your skills to the test and let you show off what you know. It's honestly a really cool feeling to get through a task and then get the go-ahead from the code checker. Even if you don't get everything completely correct the first time, the reviewers give you great tips to help you get it right. If you ever get stuck on something, it's so easy to find help within the community of other students and tutors or even your personal success manager that is just there to help you with everything.\nBuilt into the course is a career prep course where they help you do things like improve your online presence with LinkedIn, craft a great resume, write a perfect cover letter, and even tips on how to interview for your dream job. They work these into the course so that you are improving on skills that you are currently learning so you can really expand on your skills and knowledge. While I haven't quite finished yet, I still feel like I'm ready to go into the Business Analytics field. And I'm super excited about it. They also have real-life projects that you can complete for real companies to give them results and get real-world experience and practice while even getting real results you can put on your LinkedIn. The lessons are broken up into sprints to mimic the real world and make it easy to break up your time. After each sprint you get a completion badge that you can post on your LinkedIn to show off your newly learned skills. It's super cool getting to show off each skill that I learn. It makes me super proud every time I post one. And it makes your profile look even better to future recruiters or employers that might be looking you up. Even my friends and colleagues have noticed all of my newly acquired skills and are impressed and always have lots of questions. I've been messaged by recruiters noticing my new skills as well so that's super promising.Talking more about the specific Business Intelligence Analytics that I'm in, it covers some of everything. Starting off with learning everything Excel, which is something that you're definitely going to use in basically every job you get, and then learning how to make visualizations in powerful programs like Tableau and Power BI. These are very strong programs that can basically do everything. If you think you can make cool things in excel or power point, they have nothing on these tools. They are very powerful and once you fully learn to use them, there isn't much you can't do. Another powerful and important program you learn to use is SQL. This is a program to communicate with and connect various databases. It's definitely a skill that will be important in any job I have.Not only does the course cover these hard skills like software skills but also soft skills like speaking, presenting, interviewing, working in a team, managing your time both personally and professionally, and even networking to find a better job and help you in life. Soft skills are something that is definitely very overlooked in most programs and life in general. Being able to create a fantastic and informal report is a great thing, but if you can't effectively communicate your results than it really takes away from your skills. By working soft skills into the course, you get a great chance to learn everything. I'm almost through the course and I'm so excited to finish up and get started in a new career in business analytics. Do yourself a favor and get this course. Better your life and career.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sheldon Kinsler"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I was looking to pivot my career and decided to take a look into bootcamps and after some research, found TripleTen to be very attractive given that they have a money back guarantee if they're not able to help you land a job 6 months after graduation.

They have weekly coworking sessions that you can attend to speak directly with the tutors and go over any questions/concerns you may have.

When I began learning JavaScript I just didn't know what I was doing and if whether or not I was doing it right. I lacked a feedback loop and a reviewer to give me information on whether or not my code was best practice or not. I chose TripleTen not just because you could pay partial up front and then you don't have to pay again until you find your first job. I chose them because of the curriculum, I enjoyed the idea of being so proficient in the language that gave me such a hard time as a self learner, that I could use it for Frontend and Backend using Node.js. The TripleTen path was for me the quickest route to obtaining the skills that I needed to reach my goal. I spend roughly 30+ hours per week on the platform going through the sprints which are created in a way to bring you from no knowledge up to a Software Engineer! My favorite activities within TripleTen is participating within their neat independent coding challenges, as well as taking advantage of the 1 to 1 tutor Office hours. TripleTen has helped me feel more confident in my ability to code in general. They've helped me refine the knowledge I came in with (which looking back on it was very little!) as well as expand my view on everything else that comes with being a Software Engineer not just coding, other important factors like networking and resume advice. For those of you who are thinking this of this oppurtunity as something you missed out on/too late for you start, or it being to risky. I have a quote for you that helps me make decisions, \"Most people tip toe through life, hoping they make it safely to death.\" -Earl Nightingale. Thinking about it like that you realize it's a losing game, you only have one life make the most of it! Useful tips for those of you who are starting your journey. There will be times where you struggle embrace those times that's where the learning happens, feeling frustrated is completely normal and taking breaks away from it is extemely recommended. For me when I encounter a problem I try and figure it out. If I've tried everything I take a break, go on a walk, read, garden do anything then come back to it usually thats the answer to majority of your problems. If you still are encountering problems then talk with your tutors! They are very knowledgable and will guide you in a way where that caliber of problem won't give you such a hard time the next time you recieve it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sayvon Edmondson"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-12T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've been working in data analytics for over 7 years, but lacked advanced analytics/data science skill sets. I knew I had this skill gap, but was always overwhelmed by ~*how*~ I should learn these skills in a comprehensive and informed way on my own. There are so many resources out there that it's overwhelming.Unfortunately, my role was impacted by tech layoffs and I decided now was a great time to invest in myself and build these skills. As I was still actively searching/interviewing for new roles, and with the knowledge that I might soon be balancing a full time position again, I needed a bootcamp program that was well regarded and flexible. I chose TripleTen because the schedule is entirely flexible and self-paced without cutting any educational corners. You truly have to showcase what you have learned with every component of the curriculum to move forward and these applied projects are exactly what is so valuable about the bootcamp--you walk away with a portfolio of work that proves your ability to apply these skills and it gives you a competitive edge in the job search process.Not to mention, TripleTen was one of the most affordable options I could find of this caliber. I saved $4k compared to similar programs. There is as much support as you need from their team, but you can also go through it as independently as you'd like-- that was perfect for me.Initially, I reached out to a few different bootcamp programs to collect more information about the bootcamps and for them to assess my fit/alignment with the program. To be honest, I was shocked at how bad some of these intake calls were, and particularly at springboard. When I got on the phone with someone from TripleTen, it was immediately a different story. I felt like they completely understood my needs and my background, easily, and so they completely answered my questions and validated my concerns. I literally signed up the next day because I felt so good about it. TripleTen's program has already taught me SO much, reignited my love for learning, and given me confidence that I desperately needed during a very discouraging period of being laid off. It added structure to my days and weeks and I already feel the difference in my ability to complete relevant work and perform well in interviews. I love how interactive the learning is and the program consistently ties it all together to help you continually practice and understand how to approach real-work scenarios. As an analyst for many years, I can confirm the projects are very applicable and relevant.Of course, there are pros and cons to bootcamps vs. degrees, but for my situation, this was perfect. Employers care about your ability to prove impact. Period. I'm truly so happy I decided to do this bootcamp with TripleTen and can't recommend it more highly.If you're on the fence, my advice is to just do it if you can afford it. I truly love it and find it well worth the investment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Natalie"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-13T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I ran into an Add on IG about 6 - 7 months ago right when I was thinking on doing a career change. What I saw immediately called my attention and I knew it would be a perfect match for me. Its hard to explain but it was what I was looking for. I booked a call and obtain more information about the program and what called my attention the most was how well it seem to be structured and the confidence when I was told after graduating if I didn't get a Job I'd get my money back. It almost sounded too good to be true. At the time it was exactly the best time for me to get going with the program so the recruiter offered to follow up 2 months after to see if the time was right. I pretty much went full research mode those 2 months and couldn't find one single reason not to join Tripleten. Everything just seem so much better than any other online school out there and yet very affordable.Once I started I quickly realized I picked the right one.The learning process is very entertaining and even feels playful and fun while keeping the professionalism you would expect. My initial plan was to dedicate between 10 and 15 hours a week and I will admit at times it was tough because you know, work, family (I have 2 kids), life in general... but even then I still found ways to stay on track and not fall behind. I owe that to the instructors, tutors and well the whole Tripleten community. It is a very supportive community I have to say, probably one of the thing I loved the most once I got going.The Projects are fully relatable to the material you learn. They are challenging enough to push you but not to break you, and if for whatever reason you cant seem to figure it out, there's always someone available to help. Your success manager will reach out here and there to check on you and your progress. Overall to make sure you are still on track to succeed and if you are not, to get you back on track.I am a Chemical formulations group leader for a Biotech company, so manufacturing and even though I'm a little tech-savvy, not in a million years I thought i would be able to learn coding with such ease. It makes you look at everything in such a different perspective and honestly it boosted my confidence even more. Since day 1 I knew I wanted this but then I told myself, \"Ok, now I know I can absolutely do this\". It doesn't matter how things turn out, at the end I will walk out of this with so many more options to succeed and provide everything a father wants to provide to his family. I swear i look at everything different now and often find myself breaking things down in an analytical way, for no reason, its almost a little mental game at this point.The one advise I can give people is to not overthink things to much. Sometimes we are our worst enemies and our biggest obstacles. Many times I found myself lost on a project and it was because I was not looking at what was presented to me, I was too worried about the more complex equations or codes and would end up mixing things up in my head. Once I got over that things got so much easier to process. I guess what we need to understand is that just because we don't know something or are not experts on something doesn't mean that something will be harder to learn and master than any other stuff we have conquered in the past. First we crawl, then we walk, then we run, then we jump and then we can do all 4 plus more.Another little advise is that you should do all the research you need to do prior to joining Tripleten so you fully understand who they are, how they work and how they will help you get to where you want to get. Once you decide to join, step on the gas and don't let go. The worst thin you can do is to start and take long breaks in between. Remember this is a new journey, everything you will encounter is expected to be new to you and the only way you will get better is with constant practice. Have a plan and stick to that plan. It will be over sooner than what you think. 4 - 5 months will go by and you wont even notice. And don't be afraid to reach out to tutors or even your success manager, they are there to support you!Good luck on your new journey!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alberniz Garcia Minaya"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-14T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I started learning with TripleTen about 3 months ago, and I have loved my experience so far! I have been transitioning into the tech industry for the past 3 years, and have been struggling to get my foot in the door. My previous experience entails a UX/UI Design bootcamp, a year long software contract that got terminated due to a hiring freeze in the company, and a training in Full Stack Development, along with some tangential learning on side platforms like Codecademy and Leetcode. As I continue to gather experience and learning, I found a curiosity for the Data Science field and the importance of methodical data handling in the age of AI and chatbots. This led me to the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far.One of my favorite things about the TripleTen learning experience is the user interface of the learning platform. As someone who took a bootcamp on UX/UI Design previously, I have been able to notice the nuances of how good/bad UI can affect my relationship with a product or service. With that said, the TripleTen learning platform is clean and concise. There is a homepage dashboard that is easy to follow and navigate, with all the lessons I'll learn throughout the bootcamp laid out and detailed through a Curriculum view and a Calendar View. With this Curriculum view, I am able to look into the future course plan and figure out how much time to dedicate to my learning for any given week, especially since there is some overlap between the Data Science bootcamp and my previous learning. The Calendar View shows the different \"Sprints\" (chunks that the lessons are split into) across the course of about 7 months, with each Sprint taking up about 2 weeks. In my opinion and experience, this pace is very manageable. My current schedule consists of many opening shifts at a grocery store, and investing a couple of hours every other day or so is just enough for the pace that TripleTen sets. I also enjoy the fact that TripleTen is self-paced, so I don't have to log on between 9am and 5pm on weekdays or so (like a past training experience that I had), but rather I can work on it whenever I want and however quickly I want. I can speed through sections that I have a decent amount of experience with already, and spend more time with newer material. This also means that depending on how much time and effort I put in, I could feasibly and reasonably aim to finish the bootcamp earlier than the 7 month mark, and land a job more quickly that I expected.Another great resource that TripleTen has to offer is their Discord server. This is a community of other bootcampers that are working through similar problems and courses that I am. TripleTen will start many of us at the same time in what's called a \"cohort,\" so that our \"two-week sprint\" schedule aligns with a batch of other bootcampers. This allows us to learn and experience the course material together, almost like a class or graduating year, even while we are self-paced and asynchronous. The Discord server also connects us with our Student Success Manager and different tutors. Each TripleTen bootcamper has a Student Success Manager that checks in with them throughout the learning process and serves as a point of contact for any and all of our questions throughout the bootcamp. They ensure that we are staying on track and are supported throughout the learning process. When we are struggling with course material, they direct us to fellow learners or tutor coworking sessions. When we are falling behind in our program due to external circumstances (like our personal schedules or time management), the Student Success Managers walk with us and do everything they can to give us the support we need, whether that's more tutor time or accountability with a more consistent study schedule. The Discord server also has tutors that host coworking sessions, which are similar to \"office hours\" where bootcampers can stop by in and ask questions. The last resource I'll talk about, and one of the main things that drew me to TripleTen, is their career acceleration program. As someone who is about halfway through the program, I can confidently say that TripleTen invests a lot of time, effort, and resources towards our goals, which is often landing a job. There is a specific course within the TripleTen curriculum, called the Career Prep Course, that gives us the tools we need to get ready and implement our job search, especially in such a wide and saturated market. The Career Prep Course gives us an opportunity to develop a job search strategy, revamp our resumes, and prepare for job interviews and coding challenges that we may encounter. I am very happy with my experience with TripleTen so far, and can't wait to see the fruits of my labor land me a job in the near future!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Parker Shyu"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Business Intelligence Analytics","description":"Join our Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp to earn ~$73,000 in your first job after graduation and take advantage of remote-friendly opportunities","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P4M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-17T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I’m very satisfied with my Tripleten experience!

I saw an ad for TripleTen and decided to look into it. After reading a ton of positive reviews I decided to take the first step and reach out to an advisor. I thought I was going to get some sort of automated system or something else, but I got a call from an actual real human being, Oscar, who was super nice, helpful, and not pushy at all. After the call I decided to give TripleTen a go.I chose the software engineering program because I felt that gave me a good chance at a great career with a good work / life balance, and I wanted to learn how to build websites.I can't say enough how much the tutors and community managers absolutely make the program amazing. I don't feel at all like a customer, I feel like a student, and whenever I need help I can get it. The discord is also very active and gives you the opportunity to talk to other students as well as tutors.The program is split between theory and projects. The theory contains tasks and problems to work through as well as quizzes to help you learn the material. The projects are real life websites that you get to build and keep in your portfolio and are an amazing way to actually apply what you're learning, and they get more advanced as you go!You also get access to career coaches that answer your questions, and can be a great resource for chatting with someone in the industry. Most of the tutors are actual software engineers with real jobs so you have the chance to gain insight from them as well.Along with that, they have all sorts of resources to take advantage of like seminars about the industry, important changes and information and really a lot more. You can study with other students or take part in challenges, watch videos on tech, and they even have an off topic section on discord where people just post thoughts and funny stuff which really makes it feel like an actual community.One of the best parts is there is technically no set schedule, the office hours (time with tutors) are scheduled, but they have them spread throughout the day so chances are you will be able to attend at least some of them, and they give you enough time to complete your projects. You can also schedule a 1 on 1 time with a tutor if needed.The program is not a free certificate either, you really learn and you learn a lot. It's very in depth and I would say be ready to devote real effort to complete it, because they're really trying to prepare you for a real world job where you need technical programming skills. I typically put in 20-30 hours a week into the program, but it doesn't feel overwhelming.Overall, I would 10 out of 10 recommend TripleTen to someone looking to get into programming and the tech industry, I feel lucky that this is the program I went with. Looking forward to graduate this year!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Travis Sutton"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
