Throughout the entire course I had the help of amazing and patient tutors and wonderful managers. I learned more than I could image throughout the course and it was the perfect way of learning... read through the material chunks at a time and then a hands-on material way of learning. No worries if it does not make total sense right away because the tutors are always there wanting to help you. They don&#39;t just give you the answer; they teach you in a way to help you understand it the best you can! I have nothing to say but great and amazing things to say about Triple Ten and I tell you to join because you will love it!!!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Arsenii Peskovatskov&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;One particular day at my tech startup job as a marketing assistant stands out from the rest. Engaging with the QA Engineering team, I was spellbound by their precise knack for detecting glitches and ensuring seamless user experience.

What truly sets this course apart is the practical component. The projects, while initially intimidating, were perfectly balanced with the material covered. Thanks to the clarity and depth of the course content, I found myself confidently tackling each project with ease. This seamless integration of theory and practice makes the course not only enriching but also immensely enjoyable. I wholeheartedly give it a 5-star rating and urge anyone interested in business intelligence to give it a try.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Business Intelligence Analytics&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;business-intelligence-analytics&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Brittney Alfieri&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Overall I think I had a great experience through TripleTen. As someone who came from a project coordinator background I had no previous experience with coding. Their program is beginner friendly and I think that is because of the system they have set in place. Through your experience at Tripleten you go through sprints which are about two weeks. The platform goes through written lessons as well as an area to practice your code. Towards the end of that sprint is a project where you can really test out what you learned through your lessons and practice code. Your projects are then reviewed by software engineers who do line by line analysis. This really helped me get a glimpse of how they think and also best practices when coding. One of the reasons why I decided on TripleTen is because they were the only ones who seemed to have a solid support system for you as you go through the program. They do that by providing tutors, those tutors often do group sessions or even 1 on 1 to make sure you properly understand the content. It really helped elevate my understanding of coding and having the confidence to learn and perform. The best part about doing the projects is you are building your portfolio. So by the time that you end your experience with TripleTen you have something to show for employers. They also have an awesome experience where you can do an externship at the program. That gives you real work experience to put on resume. It&#39;s done in a group of multiple students and you work on a project for a company. Since graduating, I have begun working on smaller projects for myself. It&#39;s awesome to be able to create a project form start to finish and know you did that!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dallin Sly&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I chose Triple Ten for several compelling reasons, each of which played a pivotal role in shaping my decision-making process. At the forefront was the confidence instilled by their money-back guarantee—a testament to their commitment to delivering tangible results. Witnessing Triple Ten backing their promises with such assurance made it almost instinctive for me to opt for their program. Additionally, the impressive statistics surrounding employment rates and graduation outcomes further solidified my choice.\n\nHaving spent the past five years as a commercial truck driver, I intimately understand the toll such a career can take on personal and familial life. The scarcity of leisure time in this profession underscored the importance of selecting a program that not only catered to beginners but also paved a promising career trajectory. With this in mind, Triple Ten emerged as the ideal candidate, offering a curriculum that balanced accessibility with professional relevance.\n\nMy journey with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative. As a novice in the realm of technology, I entered the program with trepidation, unsure of my aptitude for coding. However, the unwavering support and guidance provided by the tutors and success managers quickly assuaged my concerns. Their patience and expertise not only facilitated my comprehension but also nurtured a newfound sense of confidence in my abilities. \n\nWhat truly surprised me during my tenure at Triple Ten was the extent of my own competence. As I approached my final project, apprehension loomed large, fearing I lacked the proficiency to execute it independently. Yet, to my amazement, I not only met the project&#39;s requirements but also demonstrated an aptitude for grasping new concepts on the fly. This adaptability, fostered by Triple Ten&#39;s emphasis on self-directed learning, proved to be a defining lesson—one that transcends coding. In other words, Triple Ten turned me into a competent learner on top of all the hard skills that I gained during the 20 hours or so hours I spent a week on the platform.\nBeyond equipping me with technical prowess, Triple Ten imparted invaluable skills essential for professional success. The program&#39;s steadfast focus on employability ensured that every lesson and assignment honed skills directly applicable to the industry. As I peruse job listings on leading platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter, I am struck by the multitude of positions for which I am now eminently qualified. In fact, many postings align perfectly with the skills and proficiencies I&#39;ve acquired, underscoring the program&#39;s efficacy in preparing graduates for real-world opportunities.\n\nIn essence, Triple Ten didn&#39;t just teach me how to code—it empowered me to become a proficient developer poised for success in a competitive landscape. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and self-reliance, they&#39;ve not only equipped me with technical acumen but also instilled the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes my way. My experience with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative, setting the stage for a fulfilling and rewarding career in the tech industry.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Daniel Pocock&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In November, I signed up with TripleTen and am now about 70% through the Data Science program. Here’s my take on it so far (good and bad). \n\nHow TripleTen won me over before signing up:\n\n- Experience: TripleTen was the only one of my top options that offered at least one externship for my program. Note that not all programs did when I signed up.\n- Guarantees: Better guarantees than other companies for job placement in terms of salary and time looking for a job\n- Cost: For what they were offering, other bootcamps were charging double after looking at financial repayment options\n- Coursework: The syllabus spoke to me more with a heavier emphasis on machine learning\n- Staff: The team was more responsive, positive and transparent than others. They were confidence boosting and believed in my abilities after learning about my background.\n\nWhere TripleTen struggled against other bootcamps:\n\n- Alumni: Older more established bootcamps offered a better alumni network\n- Testing out: Other bootcamps allowed students to test out certain subjects if they knew the content.\n- Requirements: An interview with them and a quiz can help you decide a program to go for, but unsure exactly how they decide if you are a good fit for the program. Like anyone they have an incentive to sign you on.\n- Flexibility: Other programs let you choose an emphasis within programs&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Elliott Richard&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I had originally got into the program because of how accessible it was and what they had promised through their tuition and the grantee it would help me find a career. However I found the program to be incredibly insightful not only to standard practices but how close to industry standards they were.

TT has a well structured curriculum that is (mostly) self-paced and takes you from the bare basics of HTML and CSS all the way through JavaScript, React, Express, and MongoDB. The program&#39;s vast network of community managers, success managers, and tutors ensure that you will be supported at every step. This was an overall positive experience for me. When I needed some help on a tricky problem or I needed a break because of illness, someone was there to quickly help me out. Finally, TripleTen is quite worth the cost. Looking at some other top rated bootcamps, I really cannot believe the price. For the amount of time, support, and the curriculum you get, the price is reasonable.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Career Karma&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Alina T</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I really enjoy this course.

The TripleTen platform brilliantly provided an almost real-world QA environment. Tasked with challenges from bug detection to drafting test scenarios, every project felt like a direct peek into what lay ahead in the industry. And, the camaraderie formed with my tutors and fellow students was pure gold. Our Discord channel, became our digital hub for sharing insights, seeking solutions, and sprinkling in a bit of humor.

The platform goes through written lessons as well as an area to practice your code. Towards the end of that sprint is a project where you can really test out what you learned through your lessons and practice code. Your projects are then reviewed by software engineers who do line by line analysis. This really helped me get a glimpse of how they think and also best practices when coding. One of the reasons why I decided on TripleTen is because they were the only ones who seemed to have a solid support system for you as you go through the program. They do that by providing tutors, those tutors often do group sessions or even 1 on 1 to make sure you properly understand the content. It really helped elevate my understanding of coding and having the confidence to learn and perform. The best part about doing the projects is you are building your portfolio. So by the time that you end your experience with TripleTen you have something to show for employers. They also have an awesome experience where you can do an externship at the program. That gives you real work experience to put on resume. It&#39;s done in a group of multiple students and you work on a project for a company. Since graduating, I have begun working on smaller projects for myself. It&#39;s awesome to be able to create a project form start to finish and know you did that! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Dallin Sly</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose Triple Ten for several compelling reasons, each of which played a pivotal role in shaping my decision-making process.

Additionally, the impressive statistics surrounding employment rates and graduation outcomes further solidified my choice.

Having spent the past five years as a commercial truck driver, I intimately understand the toll such a career can take on personal and familial life. The scarcity of leisure time in this profession underscored the importance of selecting a program that not only catered to beginners but also paved a promising career trajectory. With this in mind, Triple Ten emerged as the ideal candidate, offering a curriculum that balanced accessibility with professional relevance.

My journey with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative. As a novice in the realm of technology, I entered the program with trepidation, unsure of my aptitude for coding. However, the unwavering support and guidance provided by the tutors and success managers quickly assuaged my concerns. Their patience and expertise not only facilitated my comprehension but also nurtured a newfound sense of confidence in my abilities. 

What truly surprised me during my tenure at Triple Ten was the extent of my own competence. As I approached my final project, apprehension loomed large, fearing I lacked the proficiency to execute it independently. Yet, to my amazement, I not only met the project&#39;s requirements but also demonstrated an aptitude for grasping new concepts on the fly. This adaptability, fostered by Triple Ten&#39;s emphasis on self-directed learning, proved to be a defining lesson—one that transcends coding. In other words, Triple Ten turned me into a competent learner on top of all the hard skills that I gained during the 20 hours or so hours I spent a week on the platform.
Beyond equipping me with technical prowess, Triple Ten imparted invaluable skills essential for professional success. The program&#39;s steadfast focus on employability ensured that every lesson and assignment honed skills directly applicable to the industry. As I peruse job listings on leading platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter, I am struck by the multitude of positions for which I am now eminently qualified. In fact, many postings align perfectly with the skills and proficiencies I&#39;ve acquired, underscoring the program&#39;s efficacy in preparing graduates for real-world opportunities.

In essence, Triple Ten didn&#39;t just teach me how to code—it empowered me to become a proficient developer poised for success in a competitive landscape. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and self-reliance, they&#39;ve not only equipped me with technical acumen but also instilled the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes my way. My experience with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative, setting the stage for a fulfilling and rewarding career in the tech industry. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://careerkarma.com/schools/tripleten/" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Career Karma</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Daniel Pocock</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>In November, I signed up with TripleTen and am now about 70% through the Data Science program. Here’s my take on it so far (good and bad). 

How TripleTen won me over before signing up:

- Experience: TripleTen was the only one of my top options that offered at least one externship for my program. N... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ote that not all programs did when I signed up.
- Guarantees: Better guarantees than other companies for job placement in terms of salary and time looking for a job
- Cost: For what they were offering, other bootcamps were charging double after looking at financial repayment options
- Coursework: The syllabus spoke to me more with a heavier emphasis on machine learning
- Staff: The team was more responsive, positive and transparent than others. They were confidence boosting and believed in my abilities after learning about my background.

Where TripleTen struggled against other bootcamps:

- Alumni: Older more established bootcamps offered a better alumni network
- Testing out: Other bootcamps allowed students to test out certain subjects if they knew the content.
- Requirements: An interview with them and a quiz can help you decide a program to go for, but unsure exactly how they decide if you are a good fit for the program. Like anyone they have an incentive to sign you on.

As someone who came from a project coordinator background I had no previous experience with coding. Their program is beginner friendly and I think that is because of the system they have set in place. Through your experience at Tripleten you go through sprints which are about two weeks. The platform goes through written lessons as well as an area to practice your code. Towards the end of that sprint is a project where you can really test out what you learned through your lessons and practice code. Your projects are then reviewed by software engineers who do line by line analysis. This really helped me get a glimpse of how they think and also best practices when coding. One of the reasons why I decided on TripleTen is because they were the only ones who seemed to have a solid support system for you as you go through the program. They do that by providing tutors, those tutors often do group sessions or even 1 on 1 to make sure you properly understand the content. It really helped elevate my understanding of coding and having the confidence to learn and perform. The best part about doing the projects is you are building your portfolio. So by the time that you end your experience with TripleTen you have something to show for employers. They also have an awesome experience where you can do an externship at the program. That gives you real work experience to put on resume. It's done in a group of multiple students and you work on a project for a company. Since graduating, I have begun working on smaller projects for myself. It's awesome to be able to create a project form start to finish and know you did that!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brittney Alfieri"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"I chose Triple Ten for several compelling reasons, each of which played a pivotal role in shaping my decision-making process. At the forefront was the confidence instilled by their money-back guarantee—a testament to their commitment to delivering tangible results. Witnessing Triple Ten backing their promises with such assurance made it almost instinctive for me to opt for their program. Additionally, the impressive statistics surrounding employment rates and graduation outcomes further solidified my choice.\n\nHaving spent the past five years as a commercial truck driver, I intimately understand the toll such a career can take on personal and familial life. The scarcity of leisure time in this profession underscored the importance of selecting a program that not only catered to beginners but also paved a promising career trajectory. With this in mind, Triple Ten emerged as the ideal candidate, offering a curriculum that balanced accessibility with professional relevance.\n\nMy journey with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative. As a novice in the realm of technology, I entered the program with trepidation, unsure of my aptitude for coding. However, the unwavering support and guidance provided by the tutors and success managers quickly assuaged my concerns. Their patience and expertise not only facilitated my comprehension but also nurtured a newfound sense of confidence in my abilities. \n\nWhat truly surprised me during my tenure at Triple Ten was the extent of my own competence. As I approached my final project, apprehension loomed large, fearing I lacked the proficiency to execute it independently. Yet, to my amazement, I not only met the project's requirements but also demonstrated an aptitude for grasping new concepts on the fly. This adaptability, fostered by Triple Ten's emphasis on self-directed learning, proved to be a defining lesson—one that transcends coding. In other words, Triple Ten turned me into a competent learner on top of all the hard skills that I gained during the 20 hours or so hours I spent a week on the platform.\nBeyond equipping me with technical prowess, Triple Ten imparted invaluable skills essential for professional success. The program's steadfast focus on employability ensured that every lesson and assignment honed skills directly applicable to the industry. As I peruse job listings on leading platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter, I am struck by the multitude of positions for which I am now eminently qualified. In fact, many postings align perfectly with the skills and proficiencies I've acquired, underscoring the program's efficacy in preparing graduates for real-world opportunities.\n\nIn essence, Triple Ten didn't just teach me how to code—it empowered me to become a proficient developer poised for success in a competitive landscape. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and self-reliance, they've not only equipped me with technical acumen but also instilled the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes my way. My experience with Triple Ten has been nothing short of transformative, setting the stage for a fulfilling and rewarding career in the tech industry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dallin Sly"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"In November, I signed up with TripleTen and am now about 70% through the Data Science program. Here’s my take on it so far (good and bad). \n\nHow TripleTen won me over before signing up:\n\n- Experience: TripleTen was the only one of my top options that offered at least one externship for my program. Note that not all programs did when I signed up.\n- Guarantees: Better guarantees than other companies for job placement in terms of salary and time looking for a job\n- Cost: For what they were offering, other bootcamps were charging double after looking at financial repayment options\n- Coursework: The syllabus spoke to me more with a heavier emphasis on machine learning\n- Staff: The team was more responsive, positive and transparent than others. They were confidence boosting and believed in my abilities after learning about my background.\n\nWhere TripleTen struggled against other bootcamps:\n\n- Alumni: Older more established bootcamps offered a better alumni network\n- Testing out: Other bootcamps allowed students to test out certain subjects if they knew the content.\n- Requirements: An interview with them and a quiz can help you decide a program to go for, but unsure exactly how they decide if you are a good fit for the program. Like anyone they have an incentive to sign you on.\n- Flexibility: Other programs let you choose an emphasis within programs","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Pocock"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"Date not available","reviewBody":"I had originally got into the program because of how accessible it was and what they had promised through their tuition and the grantee it would help me find a career.

TT has a well structured curriculum that is (mostly) self-paced and takes you from the bare basics of HTML and CSS all the way through JavaScript, React, Express, and MongoDB. The program's vast network of community managers, success managers, and tutors ensure that you will be supported at every step. This was an overall positive experience for me. When I needed some help on a tricky problem or I needed a break because of illness, someone was there to quickly help me out. Finally, TripleTen is quite worth the cost. Looking at some other top rated bootcamps, I really cannot believe the price. For the amount of time, support, and the curriculum you get, the price is reasonable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Francis Flanagan"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-sxnsrdtv="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
