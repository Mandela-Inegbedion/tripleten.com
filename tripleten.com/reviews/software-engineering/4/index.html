I&#39;ve been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React at the moment. I&#39;m hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get \&quot;stuck\&quot; or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can&#39;t make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They&#39;re such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can&#39;t comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an \&quot;apiary\&quot; or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven&#39;t known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn&#39;t been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don&#39;t really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it&#39;s necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.\nOverall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I&#39;m hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tyler Tellez&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1691092800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;TripleTen is a great program for anyone. The go-at-your-own pace is perfect to fit the learning in with your lifestyle. The material is up-to-date and presented in a fun, informative, and interactive platform. TripleTen also provides a community space where students from every level often interact. Team members from TripleTen are also very active in the community, tutors and mentors are constantly helping with questions and are often very detailed and able to help walk you through solving any problems in a way that helps you retain the information. Another plus from this company is that they provide constant access to people that help guide you through the process of obtaining a job. These mentors help with everything necessary to be as prepared as possible to land not only an interview, but to excel in it and land the job. TripleTen is a must for anyone looking to obtain real-world skills in Software Engineering.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dararat Bishop&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1693339200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In my previous role, I served as a home care nurse. Despite having no prior experience in IT, I decided to pursue software engineering. I needed a career that would offer greater flexibility and allow me to work remotely. The IT program fascinated me and felt relevant, given the significance of technology in our daily lives. Balancing work as a nurse and being a full-time mother was a true test, especially during pregnancy and caring for a young child. Luckily, TripleTen presented me with an opportunity to take an introductory course and submit a small project to assess my suitability for the program. Some students progressed faster than others during the program. I dedicated 25-35 hours each week to completing activities and projects, often waking up early and working late into the night. However, the interactive platform made learning and practicing in each sprint more manageable. It was not an easy program, but it was a captivating and enjoyable one. With hard work and support from the team, I overcame all the challenges. Throughout my coding journey with TripleTen, I had access to excellent support teams, including Discords, tutors, and community managers, who were always willing to assist. Whenever I faced any coding challenges or issues with my project, I could always find solutions in Discords or seek help from tutors. Similarly, I could reach out to the community managers if I encountered any program-related problems. Moreover, I got the chance to apply for an externship to work on a real project during the program, gaining valuable experience before entering the job market. The career support team was always available to support me. In conclusion, the IT program I undertook was challenging but engaging. With dedication, excellent time management, and support from the team, I successfully completed it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dillon Arnold&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1693944000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=62768#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently a student halfway through TripleTens Software Engineering program. First and foremost, the curriculum is top-notch. The tutors are not only experts in their respective fields but also excellent educators. They have a knack for breaking down complex concepts into digestible pieces, making it accessible to learners of all backgrounds.

With its outstanding curriculum, hands-on approach, unwavering support, and inclusive community, this coding bootcamp sets a gold standard for tech education. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking to embark on a successful journey in the world of coding, data science and much more.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Nelson Lopez&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1694721600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108501017?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63058#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am currently on Sprint 8 of TripleTen&#39;s Software Engineering Bootcamp, and I&#39;m just starting to scratch the surface of the more advanced programming concepts. I&#39;d describe myself as tech savvy as I&#39;ve had some experience working with websites, basic code, and editing software but I did not expect this bootcamp to be this rigorous. The term \&quot;difficult\&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the intensity of this bootcamp. This bootcamp is hard work, and it requires someone willing to learn beyond TripleTen&#39;s curriculum. TripleTen does a great job laying the foundation of programming concepts and theory, and although their projects give you an opportunity to understand what you&#39;ve learned, you&#39;ll also need to build side projects on your own to truly grasp these ideas. This isn&#39;t to TripleTen&#39;s shortcomings but rather something you&#39;ll have to learn to do as an aspiring developer. You never stop learning, and you never stop building.TripleTen&#39;s curriculum is impressive. It dives deep into theory, and the content behind their interactive platform is in depth. Naturally I wonder about how much extensive programming went into building such a platform. Although TripleTen&#39;s curriculum is impressive, during the more difficult sprints their lessons start to become convoluted. There are so many points to follow, and connecting the dots gets very difficult. I found myself re-reading the same lesson 4-5 times before having a slight understanding to what they were trying to teach. Some of these sections could use more video explanations to help students comprehend better. This is probably the only minor downside to the program that I&#39;ve experienced so far. Although the more difficult sprints get confusing, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum still covers all of the relevant topics.The instructors are a huge help. They do a great job pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answers. In the long run this is beneficial to people who truly want to become software engineers that problem solve on their own. Instructors will respond with great detail and sometimes even send video recordings of themselves helping you with your bugs. Community managers are also very helpful. They&#39;re there to support you whenever you need an extension or a break.So far I&#39;m enjoying the content they create for job assistance. The advice they give on creating an online presence, networking and all of the tools you need to enter the job market is valuable. But since I haven&#39;t started the career coaching program (available after graduation), I&#39;ve put \&quot;Job Assistance\&quot; as N/A.My overall experience with TripleTen is a positive one. The instructors, tutors and community managers offer exceptional guidance throughout the program, and the curriculum is interesting and thorough. If you&#39;re thinking about pursuing a career in software engineering with TripleTen, be prepared to work harder than you can imagine. There&#39;s a reason software engineers are well compensated. It&#39;s a very complex and valuable skill to attain. If it were easy everybody would do it. Enrolling in TripleTen&#39;s Software Engineering Bootcamp proved to be both my most challenging endeavor and the most rewarding choice I&#39;ve ever made.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anthony Pham&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1695153600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112420856?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63204#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I first heard about the TripleTen coding bootcamp through a friend and on Instagram, and it quickly piqued my interest as a potential pathway to a future career in coding. Currently, I&#39;m on Sprint 9 out of 16 of the program, and I must say it has been quite a journey, one that&#39;s been both tough and incredibly fulfilling.\n\nOverall Impression:My overall impression of the TripleTen coding bootcamp is highly positive. From the moment I joined, I found the community to be exceptionally welcoming and helpful. The program does a great job of fostering a supportive environment, especially if you reach out to the community managers and the tutors. They genuinely care about your success and are readily available to assist.\n\nCurriculum:The curriculum at TripleTen starts with the basics, teaching the foundational elements of coding such as HTML and CSS. As you progress, the bootcamp dives into more advanced topics, with my current focus being JavaScript. Alongside the technical skills, they provide valuable insights into what to expect in the coding field.

Before committing to TripleTen I researched and tried out a couple of different coding programs and I found it hard to keep up with the curriculum which gave me uncertainty about the course and where it was leading me to. I found that TripleTen was the program that could work for me because of how structured the course material is, the interactive learning platform, the learning community, the career focus, and the assistance and mentorship that they provide. -Interactive Learning Platform: It was revolutionary to be able to code directly in the browser get immediate feedback and track my progress in real time making the learning process engaging and efficient. The project-based learning corresponded wonderfully with my learning style. By creating practical applications, I was able to put my academic knowledge to use in actual situations, making difficult topics understandable and approachable. It allows students to apply theoretical information to real-world settings, resulting in a better grasp of topics. -Support from the Community: The support community on TripleTen is a great source of ideas and help not just from tutors and community managers, a supportive environment was created by the willingness of other students to share their knowledge and experiences. Even though I have not fully used all that TripleTen has to offer I believe activity groups promoted a sense of community and camaraderie among students. Peer collaboration on coding projects and challenges is informative but sounds fun. It seems like an accurate reflection of how software development teams collaborate in the actual world. These workshops and activity groups at TripleTen are essential parts of the learning experience rather than merely extras. They look to have many benefits to developing new skills, and forming enduring relationships and have made learning to code both enriching and enjoyable.-Mentoring: Having a mentor who could offer advice, respond to my queries, and examine my work was quite helpful and the response times are spot on. Their advice not only helped me become a better coder but also gave me greater confidence. They establish a lively learning atmosphere where inquiries are welcomed and knowledge-sharing is prevalent.-Career Support: TripleTen&#39;s dedication to its students&#39; success after the course may be seen in the inclusion of career-related content such as résumé workshops and interview practice. Each workshop was a gold mine of information, covering everything to mastering complex algorithms. They improved my problem-solving abilities while also extending my technical skill set.  Challenges were transformed into learning opportunities through interacting with other students, working together on group projects, and asking for assistance in the forum.-Hands-On Experience: The emphasis placed on project-based learning gave me practical skills that I could immediately put to use in the workplace. -Building Confidence: As I moved through the program and dealt with progressively difficult problems, I felt much more confident in my ability to code and solve problems. I feel a great deal of accomplishment especially when spending a long time troubleshooting a problem. -Career Transition: I&#39;m sure when I get towards the end of the program I can take advantage of TripleTen&#39;s career-focused resources and support to get internships and subsequently a position as a software engineer. It also offers a route to a profession in technology and is more than just a learning platform.To those who are just beginning their coding journey, here are some tips and advice that worked for me:-Set Specific Objectives: Specify your objectives and develop a well-structured plan to reach them. Having specific goals can help you stay motivated and on course.-Keep Being Consistent: Success requires consistency. To gain momentum, give your study regular, concentrated time.-Challenges are a part of life: embrace them. Significant growth will result from embracing challenges and finding solutions.-Utilize Community: Interact with the coding community through websites like TripleTen or online discussion boards. Collaboration and the sharing of experiences are effective learning aids.-Other resources: It&#39;s okay to use Google or your favorite search engine to help you understand concepts or try out test coding. If you are more of a visual learner like me, TripleTen provides videos on some of the topics but you can take it one step further and search and watch videos on that specific topic. -Regular practice will help you become better at coding. To reinforce your learning, code frequently, work on projects, and look for coding challenges. It is advised that you should put about 20 hours of work into your studies but if time allows for it then try to get more hours in as much as you can. -Use mentors or seasoned professionals in the sector, if they are accessible. Their advice can be extremely helpful when tackling difficult subjects.-Create a portfolio of projects as you master new skills. When applying for positions, it will be essential to provide these concrete instances of your work.-Keep Up to Date: The tech sector is always changing. Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the most recent trends and technologies in the industry.-Holding yourself accountable: It&#39;s understandable that life gets in the way and you are unable to get any coding done, just make sure to make it up as soon as possible or if you can get small tasks done with the time you have. Taking a break is highly encouraged to refresh your mind. -Have confidence in your capacity to learn and develop. Coding may initially appear difficult, but with perseverance and commitment, you can succeed.Finally, my decision to use TripleTen for my coding adventure was critical in my transition into a Software Engineer. The project-centric approach, structured curriculum, interactive learning environment, and strong community support provided by the platform were great tools. TripleTen not only offered me the technical skills but also the confidence and tools I needed to succeed in the profession. For those just starting out in coding, remember that with effort, perseverance, and the correct resources, you, too, can reach your goals in software engineering.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Edna Trejo&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1695412800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Last year I decided to learn about software engineering because I wanted to find a job that pays well and also doesn&#39;t require sales. I first considered going back to school and getting a masters in software engineering but changed my mind knowing how much money and time it would take. I wanted to do something that required less time and less money. When I was doing research and trying to figure out which bootcamp to join TripleTen stood out to me the most. The price was impossible to pass up on. My journey has been great so far. Learning a new skill is always a challenge but having so many tutors and having material out there to help with any questions or issues is always available. At first organizing my time and day was a little bit of a challenge. I didn&#39;t want to give up too much of my \&quot;life\&quot; as I find myself working out 5x a week, yoga, hotworx and volleyball along with a full time job. I needed to come up with a schedule. It took time but I spend about 2-3 hours a day Monday - Friday and 6 hours on Saturdays working on my material. If I have any extra room and nothing to do I&#39;ll squeeze in more material. TripleTen does a great job at easing you into the material and when it gets more in depth they do a great job at breaking it down. I have love every part of it! If there is any advice I give is to NOT give up. There will be MANY moments where you feel like giving up but always ask for help! It makes things so much easier.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheena Irvin&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1695585600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Let me start by sharing how I got here. I was in sales, specifically in mortgage and when the market went buckwild, it was time for me to really sit and think about what I wanted to do. I wanted to enjoy my work, make money, and not worry about my next paycheck due to the economic changes. I wanted to transition to something more stable, and I didn&#39;t want to go back to a 2-4 year program/school. So I started looking into bootcamps and their success rates with getting students hired in their desired field. I chose software engineering since I was always fascinated by it, and had gotten my feet wet with it and really couldn&#39;t get enough. I probably looked at 8-10 bootcamps and compared several things based off of facts and reviews- the available support, the curriculum, the cost, was it self-paced, guaranteed, and the length of the course. All reviews led to choosing TripleTen, and glad I did. There was a scholarship from women who code that supported this program, and that also made me feel better about my choice. I spend about 20-25 hours a week studying and since I work overtime often at my current full time job, I take advantage of any opportunity I get. There are group study sessions available which is cool, but I&#39;m unable to attend those due to my crazy schedule. I have a family and work, so its kind of tough. Anyone who&#39;s available should take advantage so you feel more included and supported by the community. Everyone is so nice!! Aside from the theories and projects, I try to get practice in with codewars/leetcodes or read articles they suggest. I have a list I want to tackle after the bootcamp! The things I like most about TripleTen are: they have many tutoring sessions you can join to get help(I wish there were more in the evenings since I work 9-6 + OT but I get it), there are externship programs, they are prepping you for your future job on top of teaching you the fundamentals, and the community manager- they&#39;ve been SUPPPER helpful and honestly don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without their support. Since I&#39;ve started- I&#39;ve traveled to Europe for 2 weeks, moved, got engaged.....so lots of life happening and they&#39;ve been understanding. A good community manager is very important so you feel supported, stay on track, and don&#39;t spiral. This bootcamp has helped me so much in the sense that I feel more and more ready for the real world. I&#39;m 53% through and they&#39;ve already got me started on networking and have taught me how to revamp my LinkedIn and much more. For those who are starting: be patient with yourself, you don&#39;t have to pay $15k + to learn, find a bootcamp that meets your needs (and read the reviews!!), and know its gonna be a rollercoaster of emotions but its worth it, know you&#39;re going to have to make some sacrifices (major FOMO), and focus on the endgame. Oh, and its NEVER too late to make a change for YOU. Another thing too- I&#39;ve reached out the alumni and everyone&#39;s been so nice and responsive- they all are rooting for your success, so don&#39;t forget to take advantage of that too!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Xander JamesPomaikai Ambrosio&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1696017600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130000036?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63506#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The biggest thing that brought me to TripleTen is that the only restriction is a due date. I don&#39;t have to attend classes or wake up at a given time to reach the bare minimum. I have work and other responsibilities in my life, so I didn&#39;t find it possible to dedicate a specific time to my education. I personally don&#39;t like physical or digital classes and lectures as most of the information goes over my head and I end up having to search up the material anyway, so TripleTen mastering the hands-off approach has made me a big fan.I&#39;ve been wanting to become a Software Engineer for a good portion of my life, but the biggest setback was how costly education is. I didn&#39;t like the idea of paying all of this money for courses that I don&#39;t need and for textbooks that will be hardly used. TripleTen provides everything you need and if at any point the material becomes confusing or you don&#39;t understand the next step in the project, many instructors have office hours and even a calendar of their next meeting just to answer your questions. My favorite feature of TripleTen&#39;s Bootcamp is the Theory. Rather than throwing a bunch of lingo and words at you and then dumping a project on your lap, you instead get detailed explanations, videos, and an on-site program tool to practice the material. Whenever I get stuck on something, I refer back to the theory and everything I need is right there. TripleTen is certainly a difficult bootcamp, but they&#39;re very aware of this fact. They offer deadline extensions and even up to 3 months of a break, no questions asked. Once again, giving you that freedom of time if anything at all happens in your life that may get in the way of reaching your deadlines.If there was only one problem I had with TripleTen, it’s that they’re always upgrading. While this in of itself isn’t a bad thing and by far has brought new features I’m glad to be a part of, it just means that their old material becomes outdated and their new material is too clean, too untested. Fortunately for us we still have access to the old material and TripleTen will let you know when something noteworthy has changed and what we as the students should do about it. I love TripleTen and I would gladly recommend it to anyone interested in any of the courses they provide.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96302743?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kiffany Francis</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose TripleTen (formerly Practicum) because of the opportunities for a flexible schedule, code review, the money-back job guarantee, and live tutors and community. I&#39;ve been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>at the moment. I&#39;m hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get &quot;stuck&quot; or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can&#39;t make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They&#39;re such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can&#39;t comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an &quot;apiary&quot; or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven&#39;t known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn&#39;t been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don&#39;t really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it&#39;s necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.
Overall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I&#39;m hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60912#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Tyler Tellez</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>TripleTen is a great program for anyone.

I&#39;d describe myself as tech savvy as I&#39;ve had some experience working with websites, basic code, and editing software but I did not expect ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>this bootcamp to be this rigorous. The term &quot;difficult&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the intensity of this bootcamp. This bootcamp is hard work, and it requires someone willing to learn beyond TripleTen&#39;s curriculum. TripleTen does a great job laying the foundation of programming concepts and theory, and although their projects give you an opportunity to understand what you&#39;ve learned, you&#39;ll also need to build side projects on your own to truly grasp these ideas. This isn&#39;t to TripleTen&#39;s shortcomings but rather something you&#39;ll have to learn to do as an aspiring developer. You never stop learning, and you never stop building.TripleTen&#39;s curriculum is impressive. It dives deep into theory, and the content behind their interactive platform is in depth. Naturally I wonder about how much extensive programming went into building such a platform. Although TripleTen&#39;s curriculum is impressive, during the more difficult sprints their lessons start to become convoluted. There are so many points to follow, and connecting the dots gets very difficult. I found myself re-reading the same lesson 4-5 times before having a slight understanding to what they were trying to teach. Some of these sections could use more video explanations to help students comprehend better. This is probably the only minor downside to the program that I&#39;ve experienced so far. Although the more difficult sprints get confusing, TripleTen&#39;s curriculum still covers all of the relevant topics.The instructors are a huge help. They do a great job pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answers. In the long run this is beneficial to people who truly want to become software engineers that problem solve on their own. Instructors will respond with great detail and sometimes even send video recordings of themselves helping you with your bugs. Community managers are also very helpful. They&#39;re there to support you whenever you need an extension or a break.So far I&#39;m enjoying the content they create for job assistance. The advice they give on creating an online presence, networking and all of the tools you need to enter the job market is valuable. But since I haven&#39;t started the career coaching program (available after graduation), I&#39;ve put &quot;Job Assistance&quot; as N/A.My overall experience with TripleTen is a positive one. The instructors, tutors and community managers offer exceptional guidance throughout the program, and the curriculum is interesting and thorough. If you&#39;re thinking about pursuing a career in software engineering with TripleTen, be prepared to work harder than you can imagine. There&#39;s a reason software engineers are well compensated. It&#39;s a very complex and valuable skill to attain. If it were easy everybody would do it. Enrolling in TripleTen&#39;s Software Engineering Bootcamp proved to be both my most challenging endeavor and the most rewarding choice I&#39;ve ever made. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63058#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112420856?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anthony Pham</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I first heard about the TripleTen coding bootcamp through a friend and on Instagram, and it quickly piqued my interest as a potential pathway to a future career in coding.

Before committing to TripleTen I researched and tried out... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> a couple of different coding programs and I found it hard to keep up with the curriculum which gave me uncertainty about the course and where it was leading me to. I found that TripleTen was the program that could work for me because of how structured the course material is, the interactive learning platform, the learning community, the career focus, and the assistance and mentorship that they provide. -Interactive Learning Platform: It was revolutionary to be able to code directly in the browser get immediate feedback and track my progress in real time making the learning process engaging and efficient. The project-based learning corresponded wonderfully with my learning style. By creating practical applications, I was able to put my academic knowledge to use in actual situations, making difficult topics understandable and approachable. It allows students to apply theoretical information to real-world settings, resulting in a better grasp of topics. -Support from the Community: The support community on TripleTen is a great source of ideas and help not just from tutors and community managers, a supportive environment was created by the willingness of other students to share their knowledge and experiences. Even though I have not fully used all that TripleTen has to offer I believe activity groups promoted a sense of community and camaraderie among students. Peer collaboration on coding projects and challenges is informative but sounds fun. It seems like an accurate reflection of how software development teams collaborate in the actual world. These workshops and activity groups at TripleTen are essential parts of the learning experience rather than merely extras. They look to have many benefits to developing new skills, and forming enduring relationships and have made learning to code both enriching and enjoyable.-Mentoring: Having a mentor who could offer advice, respond to my queries, and examine my work was quite helpful and the response times are spot on. Their advice not only helped me become a better coder but also gave me greater confidence. They establish a lively learning atmosphere where inquiries are welcomed and knowledge-sharing is prevalent.-Career Support: TripleTen&#39;s dedication to its students&#39; success after the course may be seen in the inclusion of career-related content such as résumé workshops and interview practice. Each workshop was a gold mine of information, covering everything to mastering complex algorithms. They improved my problem-solving abilities while also extending my technical skill set.  Challenges were transformed into learning opportunities through interacting with other students, working together on group projects, and asking for assistance in the forum.-Hands-On Experience: The emphasis placed on project-based learning gave me practical skills that I could immediately put to use in the workplace. -Building Confidence: As I moved through the program and dealt with progressively difficult problems, I felt much more confident in my ability to code and solve problems. I feel a great deal of accomplishment especially when spending a long time troubleshooting a problem. -Career Transition: I&#39;m sure when I get towards the end of the program I can take advantage of TripleTen&#39;s career-focused resources and support to get internships and subsequently a position as a software engineer. It also offers a route to a profession in technology and is more than just a learning platform.To those who are just beginning their coding journey, here are some tips and advice that worked for me:-Set Specific Objectives: Specify your objectives and develop a well-structured plan to reach them. Having specific goals can help you stay motivated and on course.-Keep Being Consistent: Success requires consistency. To gain momentum, give your study regular, concentrated time.-Challenges are a part of life: embrace them. Significant growth will result from embracing challenges and finding solutions.-Utilize Community: Interact with the coding community through websites like TripleTen or online discussion boards. Collaboration and the sharing of experiences are effective learning aids.-Other resources: It&#39;s okay to use Google or your favorite search engine to help you understand concepts or try out test coding. If you are more of a visual learner like me, TripleTen provides videos on some of the topics but you can take it one step further and search and watch videos on that specific topic. -Regular practice will help you become better at coding. To reinforce your learning, code frequently, work on projects, and look for coding challenges. It is advised that you should put about 20 hours of work into your studies but if time allows for it then try to get more hours in as much as you can. -Use mentors or seasoned professionals in the sector, if they are accessible. Their advice can be extremely helpful when tackling difficult subjects.-Create a portfolio of projects as you master new skills. When applying for positions, it will be essential to provide these concrete instances of your work.-Keep Up to Date: The tech sector is always changing. Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the most recent trends and technologies in the industry.-Holding yourself accountable: It&#39;s understandable that life gets in the way and you are unable to get any coding done, just make sure to make it up as soon as possible or if you can get small tasks done with the time you have. Taking a break is highly encouraged to refresh your mind. -Have confidence in your capacity to learn and develop. Coding may initially appear difficult, but with perseverance and commitment, you can succeed.Finally, my decision to use TripleTen for my coding adventure was critical in my transition into a Software Engineer. The project-centric approach, structured curriculum, interactive learning environment, and strong community support provided by the platform were great tools. TripleTen not only offered me the technical skills but also the confidence and tools I needed to succeed in the profession. For those just starting out in coding, remember that with effort, perseverance, and the correct resources, you, too, can reach your goals in software engineering. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63269#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Edna Trejo</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Last year I decided to learn about software engineering because I wanted to find a job that pays well and also doesn&#39;t require sales. I first considered going back to school and getting a masters in software engineering but changed my mind knowing how much money and time it would take. I wanted to d... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>o something that required less time and less money. When I was doing research and trying to figure out which bootcamp to join TripleTen stood out to me the most. The price was impossible to pass up on. My journey has been great so far. Learning a new skill is always a challenge but having so many tutors and having material out there to help with any questions or issues is always available. At first organizing my time and day was a little bit of a challenge. I didn&#39;t want to give up too much of my &quot;life&quot; as I find myself working out 5x a week, yoga, hotworx and volleyball along with a full time job. I needed to come up with a schedule. It took time but I spend about 2-3 hours a day Monday - Friday and 6 hours on Saturdays working on my material. If I have any extra room and nothing to do I&#39;ll squeeze in more material. TripleTen does a great job at easing you into the material and when it gets more in depth they do a great job at breaking it down. I have love every part of it! If there is any advice I give is to NOT give up. There will be MANY moments where you feel like giving up but always ask for help! It makes things so much easier. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sheena Irvin</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Let me start by sharing how I got here. I was in sales, specifically in mortgage and when the market went buckwild, it was time for me to really sit and think about what I wanted to do. I wanted to enjoy my work, make money, and not worry about my next paycheck due to the economic changes. I wanted ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>to transition to something more stable, and I didn&#39;t want to go back to a 2-4 year program/school. So I started looking into bootcamps and their success rates with getting students hired in their desired field. I chose software engineering since I was always fascinated by it, and had gotten my feet wet with it and really couldn&#39;t get enough. I probably looked at 8-10 bootcamps and compared several things based off of facts and reviews- the available support, the curriculum, the cost, was it self-paced, guaranteed, and the length of the course. All reviews led to choosing TripleTen, and glad I did. There was a scholarship from women who code that supported this program, and that also made me feel better about my choice. I spend about 20-25 hours a week studying and since I work overtime often at my current full time job, I take advantage of any opportunity I get. There are group study sessions available which is cool, but I&#39;m unable to attend those due to my crazy schedule. I have a family and work, so its kind of tough. Anyone who&#39;s available should take advantage so you feel more included and supported by the community. Everyone is so nice!! Aside from the theories and projects, I try to get practice in with codewars/leetcodes or read articles they suggest. I have a list I want to tackle after the bootcamp! The things I like most about TripleTen are: they have many tutoring sessions you can join to get help(I wish there were more in the evenings since I work 9-6 + OT but I get it), there are externship programs, they are prepping you for your future job on top of teaching you the fundamentals, and the community manager- they&#39;ve been SUPPPER helpful and honestly don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without their support. Since I&#39;ve started- I&#39;ve traveled to Europe for 2 weeks, moved, got engaged.....so lots of life happening and they&#39;ve been understanding. A good community manager is very important so you feel supported, stay on track, and don&#39;t spiral. This bootcamp has helped me so much in the sense that I feel more and more ready for the real world. I&#39;m 53% through and they&#39;ve already got me started on networking and have taught me how to revamp my LinkedIn and much more. For those who are starting: be patient with yourself, you don&#39;t have to pay $15k + to learn, find a bootcamp that meets your needs (and read the reviews!!), and know its gonna be a rollercoaster of emotions but its worth it, know you&#39;re going to have to make some sacrifices (major FOMO), and focus on the endgame. Oh, and its NEVER too late to make a change for YOU. Another thing too- I&#39;ve reached out the alumni and everyone&#39;s been so nice and responsive- they all are rooting for your success, so don&#39;t forget to take advantage of that too! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on SwitchUp</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130000036?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Xander JamesPomaikai Ambrosio</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>The biggest thing that brought me to TripleTen is that the only restriction is a due date. I don&#39;t have to attend classes or wake up at a given time to reach the bare minimum. I have work and other responsibilities in my life, so I didn&#39;t find it possible to dedicate a specific time to my education.... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> I personally don&#39;t like physical or digital classes and lectures as most of the information goes over my head and I end up having to search up the material anyway, so TripleTen mastering the hands-off approach has made me a big fan.I&#39;ve been wanting to become a Software Engineer for a good portion of my life, but the biggest setback was how costly education is. I didn&#39;t like the idea of paying all of this money for courses that I don&#39;t need and for textbooks that will be hardly used. TripleTen provides everything you need and if at any point the material becomes confusing or you don&#39;t understand the next step in the project, many instructors have office hours and even a calendar of their next meeting just to answer your questions. My favorite feature of TripleTen&#39;s Bootcamp is the Theory. Rather than throwing a bunch of lingo and words at you and then dumping a project on your lap, you instead get detailed explanations, videos, and an on-site program tool to practice the material. Whenever I get stuck on something, I refer back to the theory and everything I need is right there. TripleTen is certainly a difficult bootcamp, but they&#39;re very aware of this fact. They offer deadline extensions and even up to 3 months of a break, no questions asked. Once again, giving you that freedom of time if anything at all happens in your life that may get in the way of reaching your deadlines.If there was only one problem I had with TripleTen, it’s that they’re always upgrading. While this in of itself isn’t a bad thing and by far has brought new features I’m glad to be a part of, it just means that their old material becomes outdated and their new material is too clean, too untested. Fortunately for us we still have access to the old material and TripleTen will let you know when something noteworthy has changed and what we as the students should do about it. I love TripleTen and I would gladly recommend it to anyone interested in any of the courses they provide. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=63506#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><!--]--></div><div class="reviews-sorting" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-tags" data-v-78f05f60><a href="../../index.html#reviews" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60> All programs </a><!--[--><a data-astro-prefetch href="../index.html" class="active sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Software Engineering</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../quality-assurance/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Quality Assurance</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../business-intelligence-analytics/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Business Intelligence Analytics</a><a data-astro-prefetch href="../../data-science/index.html" class="sort-tag" data-v-78f05f60>Data Science</a><!--]--></div><div class="select-container" data-v-78f05f60><div class="sort-text" data-v-78f05f60>Sort by</div><select class="sort-select" name="sortBy" id="sortBy" data-v-78f05f60><option value="most-useful" data-v-78f05f60 selected>Most useful first</option><option value="top-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Top-rated first</option><option value="low-rated" data-v-78f05f60>Low-rated first</option></select></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> <div class="pagination" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-4a0bd25e><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.2071 2.29295C11.5976 2.68348 11.5976 3.31664 11.2071 3.70717L6.91421 8.00006L11.2071 12.293C11.5976 12.6835 11.5976 13.3166 11.2071 13.7072C10.8166 14.0977 10.1834 14.0977 9.79289 13.7072L4.08579 8.00006L9.79289 2.29295C10.1834 1.90243 10.8166 1.90243 11.2071 2.29295Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a><a href="../index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>1</a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../3/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>3</span></a><a class="active" data-v-4a0bd25e><div class="active-line" data-v-4a0bd25e></div><span data-v-4a0bd25e>4</span></a><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><span data-v-4a0bd25e>5</span></a><a href="#" data-v-4a0bd25e>...</a><a href="../14/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e>14</a><a href="../5/index.html" data-v-4a0bd25e><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-4a0bd25e><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M4.79289 13.707C4.40237 13.3165 4.40237 12.6834 4.79289 12.2928L9.08579 7.99994L4.79289 3.70705C4.40237 3.31652 4.40237 2.68336 4.79289 2.29283C5.18342 1.90231 5.81658 1.90231 6.20711 2.29283L11.9142 7.99994L6.20711 13.707C5.81658 14.0976 5.18342 14.0976 4.79289 13.707Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-4a0bd25e></path></svg></a></div> </div> </div> <script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-07-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I chose TripleTen (formerly Practicum) because of the opportunities for a flexible schedule, code review, the money-back job guarantee, and live tutors and community. I've been studying for the last six months and have learned a ton. I have been immersed in JavaScript and am starting to learn React at the moment. I'm hoping to broaden my career prospects and do a job that is more challenging daily.What has been great:The format -- the program is broken down into 2-3 week sprints that are modeled after the profession. This is my favorite part of the program. You can work independently on these projects after doing some lesson on the platform. The tutoring -- If you do get \"stuck\" or need some advice or guidance, there is live tutoring available through the platform every day. If you can't make it to a session, you can post your issue or question online, and many tutors will respond with a quick video or screenshots. The tutors are great and share their own professional experiences as software developers. They're such an asset to TripleTen truly.The code review -- In the projects, we push our projects to Github and receive feedback on our projects. The Code Reviewers are top notch and give excellent suggestions and point out when things are working.The flexibility -- Sometimes, you might need an extension or may get sick or need to take a week off. The program has breaks that you can take along the way. There are 8 week-long breaks and a month-long break if needed.There are other things that I can't comment on like the career program at the end--but they do integrate career lessons into the coding lessons along the way. At the beginning, they also said that there would be opportunities to do an \"apiary\" or a cooperative work experience project with a company. I haven't known many students to do these just yet, only one who finished as I was starting six months ago. I think there are limited opportunities, so it may be something to inquire about. I also thought there would be more opportunities through the program to do Code Jams or weekend coding competitions within the bootcamp, but there hasn't been any during my time there.I think for myself as a learner, I learn the most through doing the projects in the sprint. I don't really like going through the lessons on the platform. Each sprint, I probably do 3-4 days of working through the lessons before getting the project. I'm not sure if it's because I have former development experience that I get bored, but I think they could be more precise and less dry. I do know it's necessary to convey new content in some sort of way though.\nOverall, I feel closer to being ready to apply to jobs that require HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had been learning Python in the past. I'm hoping that this will give me the push to get a better job so that I can do more for my family. This program provides a strong structure along with support in order to grow as a developer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kiffany Francis"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-08-03T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"TripleTen is a great program for anyone.

Despite having no prior experience in IT, I decided to pursue software engineering. I needed a career that would offer greater flexibility and allow me to work remotely. The IT program fascinated me and felt relevant, given the significance of technology in our daily lives. Balancing work as a nurse and being a full-time mother was a true test, especially during pregnancy and caring for a young child. Luckily, TripleTen presented me with an opportunity to take an introductory course and submit a small project to assess my suitability for the program. Some students progressed faster than others during the program. I dedicated 25-35 hours each week to completing activities and projects, often waking up early and working late into the night. However, the interactive platform made learning and practicing in each sprint more manageable. It was not an easy program, but it was a captivating and enjoyable one. With hard work and support from the team, I overcame all the challenges. Throughout my coding journey with TripleTen, I had access to excellent support teams, including Discords, tutors, and community managers, who were always willing to assist. Whenever I faced any coding challenges or issues with my project, I could always find solutions in Discords or seek help from tutors. Similarly, I could reach out to the community managers if I encountered any program-related problems. Moreover, I got the chance to apply for an externship to work on a real project during the program, gaining valuable experience before entering the job market. The career support team was always available to support me. In conclusion, the IT program I undertook was challenging but engaging. With dedication, excellent time management, and support from the team, I successfully completed it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dararat Bishop"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-05T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I am currently a student halfway through TripleTens Software Engineering program. First and foremost, the curriculum is top-notch.

I'd describe myself as tech savvy as I've had some experience working with websites, basic code, and editing software but I did not expect this bootcamp to be this rigorous. The term \"difficult\" doesn't even begin to describe the intensity of this bootcamp. This bootcamp is hard work, and it requires someone willing to learn beyond TripleTen's curriculum. TripleTen does a great job laying the foundation of programming concepts and theory, and although their projects give you an opportunity to understand what you've learned, you'll also need to build side projects on your own to truly grasp these ideas. This isn't to TripleTen's shortcomings but rather something you'll have to learn to do as an aspiring developer. You never stop learning, and you never stop building.TripleTen's curriculum is impressive. It dives deep into theory, and the content behind their interactive platform is in depth. Naturally I wonder about how much extensive programming went into building such a platform. Although TripleTen's curriculum is impressive, during the more difficult sprints their lessons start to become convoluted. There are so many points to follow, and connecting the dots gets very difficult. I found myself re-reading the same lesson 4-5 times before having a slight understanding to what they were trying to teach. Some of these sections could use more video explanations to help students comprehend better. This is probably the only minor downside to the program that I've experienced so far. Although the more difficult sprints get confusing, TripleTen's curriculum still covers all of the relevant topics.The instructors are a huge help. They do a great job pointing you in the right direction without giving you the answers. In the long run this is beneficial to people who truly want to become software engineers that problem solve on their own. Instructors will respond with great detail and sometimes even send video recordings of themselves helping you with your bugs. Community managers are also very helpful. They're there to support you whenever you need an extension or a break.So far I'm enjoying the content they create for job assistance. The advice they give on creating an online presence, networking and all of the tools you need to enter the job market is valuable. But since I haven't started the career coaching program (available after graduation), I've put \"Job Assistance\" as N/A.My overall experience with TripleTen is a positive one. The instructors, tutors and community managers offer exceptional guidance throughout the program, and the curriculum is interesting and thorough. If you're thinking about pursuing a career in software engineering with TripleTen, be prepared to work harder than you can imagine. There's a reason software engineers are well compensated. It's a very complex and valuable skill to attain. If it were easy everybody would do it. Enrolling in TripleTen's Software Engineering Bootcamp proved to be both my most challenging endeavor and the most rewarding choice I've ever made.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nelson Lopez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I first heard about the TripleTen coding bootcamp through a friend and on Instagram, and it quickly piqued my interest as a potential pathway to a future career in coding.

Before committing to TripleTen I researched and tried out a couple of different coding programs and I found it hard to keep up with the curriculum which gave me uncertainty about the course and where it was leading me to. I found that TripleTen was the program that could work for me because of how structured the course material is, the interactive learning platform, the learning community, the career focus, and the assistance and mentorship that they provide. -Interactive Learning Platform: It was revolutionary to be able to code directly in the browser get immediate feedback and track my progress in real time making the learning process engaging and efficient. The project-based learning corresponded wonderfully with my learning style. By creating practical applications, I was able to put my academic knowledge to use in actual situations, making difficult topics understandable and approachable. It allows students to apply theoretical information to real-world settings, resulting in a better grasp of topics. -Support from the Community: The support community on TripleTen is a great source of ideas and help not just from tutors and community managers, a supportive environment was created by the willingness of other students to share their knowledge and experiences. Even though I have not fully used all that TripleTen has to offer I believe activity groups promoted a sense of community and camaraderie among students. Peer collaboration on coding projects and challenges is informative but sounds fun. It seems like an accurate reflection of how software development teams collaborate in the actual world. These workshops and activity groups at TripleTen are essential parts of the learning experience rather than merely extras. They look to have many benefits to developing new skills, and forming enduring relationships and have made learning to code both enriching and enjoyable.-Mentoring: Having a mentor who could offer advice, respond to my queries, and examine my work was quite helpful and the response times are spot on. Their advice not only helped me become a better coder but also gave me greater confidence. They establish a lively learning atmosphere where inquiries are welcomed and knowledge-sharing is prevalent.-Career Support: TripleTen's dedication to its students' success after the course may be seen in the inclusion of career-related content such as résumé workshops and interview practice. Each workshop was a gold mine of information, covering everything to mastering complex algorithms. They improved my problem-solving abilities while also extending my technical skill set.  Challenges were transformed into learning opportunities through interacting with other students, working together on group projects, and asking for assistance in the forum.-Hands-On Experience: The emphasis placed on project-based learning gave me practical skills that I could immediately put to use in the workplace. -Building Confidence: As I moved through the program and dealt with progressively difficult problems, I felt much more confident in my ability to code and solve problems. I feel a great deal of accomplishment especially when spending a long time troubleshooting a problem. -Career Transition: I'm sure when I get towards the end of the program I can take advantage of TripleTen's career-focused resources and support to get internships and subsequently a position as a software engineer. It also offers a route to a profession in technology and is more than just a learning platform.To those who are just beginning their coding journey, here are some tips and advice that worked for me:-Set Specific Objectives: Specify your objectives and develop a well-structured plan to reach them. Having specific goals can help you stay motivated and on course.-Keep Being Consistent: Success requires consistency. To gain momentum, give your study regular, concentrated time.-Challenges are a part of life: embrace them. Significant growth will result from embracing challenges and finding solutions.-Utilize Community: Interact with the coding community through websites like TripleTen or online discussion boards. Collaboration and the sharing of experiences are effective learning aids.-Other resources: It's okay to use Google or your favorite search engine to help you understand concepts or try out test coding. If you are more of a visual learner like me, TripleTen provides videos on some of the topics but you can take it one step further and search and watch videos on that specific topic. -Regular practice will help you become better at coding. To reinforce your learning, code frequently, work on projects, and look for coding challenges. It is advised that you should put about 20 hours of work into your studies but if time allows for it then try to get more hours in as much as you can. -Use mentors or seasoned professionals in the sector, if they are accessible. Their advice can be extremely helpful when tackling difficult subjects.-Create a portfolio of projects as you master new skills. When applying for positions, it will be essential to provide these concrete instances of your work.-Keep Up to Date: The tech sector is always changing. Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the most recent trends and technologies in the industry.-Holding yourself accountable: It's understandable that life gets in the way and you are unable to get any coding done, just make sure to make it up as soon as possible or if you can get small tasks done with the time you have. Taking a break is highly encouraged to refresh your mind. -Have confidence in your capacity to learn and develop. Coding may initially appear difficult, but with perseverance and commitment, you can succeed.Finally, my decision to use TripleTen for my coding adventure was critical in my transition into a Software Engineer. The project-centric approach, structured curriculum, interactive learning environment, and strong community support provided by the platform were great tools. TripleTen not only offered me the technical skills but also the confidence and tools I needed to succeed in the profession. For those just starting out in coding, remember that with effort, perseverance, and the correct resources, you, too, can reach your goals in software engineering.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Pernell Bauza"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Last year I decided to learn about software engineering because I wanted to find a job that pays well and also doesn't require sales. I first considered going back to school and getting a masters in software engineering but changed my mind knowing how much money and time it would take. I wanted to do something that required less time and less money. When I was doing research and trying to figure out which bootcamp to join TripleTen stood out to me the most. The price was impossible to pass up on. My journey has been great so far. Learning a new skill is always a challenge but having so many tutors and having material out there to help with any questions or issues is always available. At first organizing my time and day was a little bit of a challenge. I didn't want to give up too much of my \"life\" as I find myself working out 5x a week, yoga, hotworx and volleyball along with a full time job. I needed to come up with a schedule. It took time but I spend about 2-3 hours a day Monday - Friday and 6 hours on Saturdays working on my material. If I have any extra room and nothing to do I'll squeeze in more material. TripleTen does a great job at easing you into the material and when it gets more in depth they do a great job at breaking it down. I have love every part of it! If there is any advice I give is to NOT give up. There will be MANY moments where you feel like giving up but always ask for help! It makes things so much easier.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edna Trejo"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-24T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Let me start by sharing how I got here. I was in sales, specifically in mortgage and when the market went buckwild, it was time for me to really sit and think about what I wanted to do. I wanted to enjoy my work, make money, and not worry about my next paycheck due to the economic changes. I wanted to transition to something more stable, and I didn't want to go back to a 2-4 year program/school. So I started looking into bootcamps and their success rates with getting students hired in their desired field. I chose software engineering since I was always fascinated by it, and had gotten my feet wet with it and really couldn't get enough. I probably looked at 8-10 bootcamps and compared several things based off of facts and reviews- the available support, the curriculum, the cost, was it self-paced, guaranteed, and the length of the course. All reviews led to choosing TripleTen, and glad I did. There was a scholarship from women who code that supported this program, and that also made me feel better about my choice. I spend about 20-25 hours a week studying and since I work overtime often at my current full time job, I take advantage of any opportunity I get. There are group study sessions available which is cool, but I'm unable to attend those due to my crazy schedule. I have a family and work, so its kind of tough. Anyone who's available should take advantage so you feel more included and supported by the community. Everyone is so nice!! Aside from the theories and projects, I try to get practice in with codewars/leetcodes or read articles they suggest. I have a list I want to tackle after the bootcamp! The things I like most about TripleTen are: they have many tutoring sessions you can join to get help(I wish there were more in the evenings since I work 9-6 + OT but I get it), there are externship programs, they are prepping you for your future job on top of teaching you the fundamentals, and the community manager- they've been SUPPPER helpful and honestly don't know what I'd do without their support. Since I've started- I've traveled to Europe for 2 weeks, moved, got engaged.....so lots of life happening and they've been understanding. A good community manager is very important so you feel supported, stay on track, and don't spiral. This bootcamp has helped me so much in the sense that I feel more and more ready for the real world. I'm 53% through and they've already got me started on networking and have taught me how to revamp my LinkedIn and much more. For those who are starting: be patient with yourself, you don't have to pay $15k + to learn, find a bootcamp that meets your needs (and read the reviews!!), and know its gonna be a rollercoaster of emotions but its worth it, know you're going to have to make some sacrifices (major FOMO), and focus on the endgame. Oh, and its NEVER too late to make a change for YOU. Another thing too- I've reached out the alumni and everyone's been so nice and responsive- they all are rooting for your success, so don't forget to take advantage of that too!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sheena Irvin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-09-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"The biggest thing that brought me to TripleTen is that the only restriction is a due date. I don't have to attend classes or wake up at a given time to reach the bare minimum. I have work and other responsibilities in my life, so I didn't find it possible to dedicate a specific time to my education. I personally don't like physical or digital classes and lectures as most of the information goes over my head and I end up having to search up the material anyway, so TripleTen mastering the hands-off approach has made me a big fan.I've been wanting to become a Software Engineer for a good portion of my life, but the biggest setback was how costly education is. I didn't like the idea of paying all of this money for courses that I don't need and for textbooks that will be hardly used. TripleTen provides everything you need and if at any point the material becomes confusing or you don't understand the next step in the project, many instructors have office hours and even a calendar of their next meeting just to answer your questions. My favorite feature of TripleTen's Bootcamp is the Theory. Rather than throwing a bunch of lingo and words at you and then dumping a project on your lap, you instead get detailed explanations, videos, and an on-site program tool to practice the material. Whenever I get stuck on something, I refer back to the theory and everything I need is right there. TripleTen is certainly a difficult bootcamp, but they're very aware of this fact. They offer deadline extensions and even up to 3 months of a break, no questions asked. Once again, giving you that freedom of time if anything at all happens in your life that may get in the way of reaching your deadlines.If there was only one problem I had with TripleTen, it’s that they’re always upgrading. While this in of itself isn’t a bad thing and by far has brought new features I’m glad to be a part of, it just means that their old material becomes outdated and their new material is too clean, too untested. Fortunately for us we still have access to the old material and TripleTen will let you know when something noteworthy has changed and what we as the students should do about it. I love TripleTen and I would gladly recommend it to anyone interested in any of the courses they provide.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Xander JamesPomaikai Ambrosio"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
