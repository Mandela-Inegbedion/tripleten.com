Initially unsure of what to expect, I quickly got into the groove. For a while I didn&#39;t need the help of the tutors, but as I delved deeper, they became a crucial resource. I have fully graduated from the program now, and overall my experience was stellar. The tutors were consistently there when I needed them, and the code reviewers offered super helpful feedback. Overall, TripleTen&#39;s software engineer boot camp exceeded my expectations. I was easily able to grasp the material, and I appreciated the gradual reduction in hand-holding as I progressed through the sprints. The emphasis on real-world projects, externship programs, and their free SQL course showcased TripleTen&#39;s dedication to a well-rounded learning experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Tyler&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687204800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60347#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I was hesitant to trust bootcamps or courses and had been searching for a company that I felt was legitimate and truly offered real-world skills. After interviewing multiple recruiters from various organizations, I decided to go with TripleTen(formerly Practicum) as their structure seemed best fit for my life. I was skeptical of ANY bootcamp that they would provide the skills I was searching for to be competitive in this field. After completing multiple steps of the Software Engineer course, it&#39;s safe to say I am thrilled that I made the decision to go with TripleTen. The course layouts and information, real-world projects, career preparation, and community of students and tutors has made this an outstanding experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dominick Harper&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687377600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121819869?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60423#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m currently enrolled in the  TripleTen Online Bootcamp, and it has completely changed my life.

The community that has been created around the bootcamp is nothing short of amazing, with a wealth of resources and support available at every step of the journey.

The exceptional flexibility of the program has been a lifeline, allowing me to tailor my learning around my schedule. The tutors are nothing short of brilliant, guiding and supporting me through each step. What has struck a chord with me is the vibrant and friendly nature of the TripleTen Discord community - a supportive network of like-minded individuals always ready to help each other grow. TripleTen provides tangible, resume-enhancing projects that give you a taste of real-world software development. They also offer an exciting internship program, which I intend to leverage to gain further practical experience. To sum it up, if you&#39;re on the hunt for a coding bootcamp that offers more than just learning to code, TripleTen is your ticket to a rewarding journey in the tech industry!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Nicoli Kazemi&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687723200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115424532?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60520#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am over halfway with the TripleTen code school and I have a positive impression overall. The goal for any bootcamp and their students is to teach them the skills (tech and non-tech) needed to break into their chosen industry. TripleTen does a good job doing that. They teach a full-stack curriculum based on JavaScript for the SE course. It is very challenging but it is logically broken up into steps going from theory to practice to building a project. If you ever get stuck, there are tutors who are skilled at the problems you are facing and will help you through it. They also teach other important skills such as networking. Overall, I think if you are interested in joining a bootcamp, TripleTen is a solid choice.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Cody O&#39;Brien&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687982400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=60671#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m still a student at TripleTen, and I&#39;ve gone through 9 of the 16 total sprints so far. From the very first one, the information was presented in a clear and effective manner. The theory is comprehensive without being overwhelming, and the exercises are great reinforcement of each of the theory segments. The projects at the end of each sprint are direct applications of the information presented in the chapter, with just enough challenge to push your skills and solidify your learning. There&#39;s just enough guidance to let you figure out things own your own, or get help from tutors. Each sprint builds on past material very well, advancing your knowledge as the program goes along. The community support and engagement is great as well. Community managers and tutors are super responsive and helpful; the scheduled office hours for students to have a planned time to ask for help and questions are very useful as well. The tutors are very knowledgeable; they&#39;re always willing to help, and explain ideas beyond the scope of projects or sprints.TripleTen has been a great experience so far, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get into software engineering.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kory Russell&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1687982400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I am a current student of Triple Ten (Formerly Practicum) and I have to say I knew going into this bootcamp after being mesmerized by the first free sprint that I loved doing this. I underestimated the intense core of what is involved, and while I still am loving this bootcamp, rest assured you will work hard to achieve the results you are looking for. I love my Community Manager- Dina, she is awesome and works with you so well, and there are some amazing tutors almost always available. Sometimes I have a hard time following the lessons and studying in Theory, but I do eventually get it, and now entering Sprint 2. I cannot wait to see what I will continue to learn. SUPER INTENSE = SUPER SATISFACTION here, and its so far worth every penny I have paid for my tuition. I have no doubts if you want the best engineering learning, this is the bootcamp to choose. I ALSO have learned so much about myself like how I am teaching myself to pay more attention to syntax and grammar, trust me it matters! I have learned how satisfying it is to finish something even if there are a few things I missed, I can go back and in real time learn how to not repeat them. It takes a while to get some of the concepts, but I like the way Practicum has laid the Sprints out, even early into the bootcamp. Thanks Triple Ten!

I was looking for a bootcamp that could fulfill a few things. I wanted it to be a strong bootcamp, with flexible hours. I work a full time job, and many other commitments, so finding something that was flexible was one of my top priorities. Many other bootcamps require you to join a live coding class, which I think is extremely helpful, but hard to commit to when you have other responsibilities. TripleTen allows me to work on my own schedule. I also find the coursework to be extremely strong, and progresses from easily to very difficult, which allows you to become accustomed to the platform, coding and learning. The community of learners is super strong helpful and encouraging.

The projects at the end of each sprint are direct applications of the information presented in the chapter, with just enough challenge to push your skills and solidify your learning. There's just enough guidance to let you figure out things own your own, or get help from tutors. Each sprint builds on past material very well, advancing your knowledge as the program goes along.

The tutors are super helpful and are often available at many different hours of the day.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marlon Nunez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}}]</script> <div class="form-container" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="orange-bg" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="links-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><h2 class="links-head" data-v-a4f06c5e>Need more reasons <br data-v-a4f06c5e>to choose TripleTen?</h2><div class="links" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We’ll help along the way</div><a href="../../../team/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer externships for work experience</div><a href="../../../externships/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>We offer flexible payment options</div><a href="../../../about/payment-options/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div><div class="link-divider" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="link" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="link-text" data-v-a4f06c5e>Our grad success metrics are phenomenal</div><a href="../../../outcomes/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-more" data-v-a4f06c5e>Learn more <img src="../../ArrowRight.svg" alt="" data-v-a4f06c5e></a></div></div></div><div class="bg_form" id="applynow" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-block" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-text desk" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors <span data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img loading="lazy" src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></span> to find out how you can get in risk-free </div><div class="form-content_tab tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="form-imgs tab" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man2.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man1.webp" alt="Photo of a woman" data-v-a4f06c5e><img src="../../man3.webp" alt="Photo of a man" data-v-a4f06c5e></div><div class="form-text tab" data-v-a4f06c5e> Talk to our advisors to find out how you can get in risk-free </div></div><div class="te-form" data-v-a4f06c5e><div class="contact-form-widget" data-program="main" data-scoring-enabled="true" data-view="horizontal" data-steps-mod="hidden" data-form-position="last_screen" data-v-a4f06c5e></div></div></div></div></div>    <footer id="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4></footer> <script>
