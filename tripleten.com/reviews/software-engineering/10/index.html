For some, they see the potential of the industry and are looking for a career change. Others are self-taught programmers but want a boot camp to fill the gaps left by YouTube. I fell into the latter camp and was looking for a structured boot camp to help fill in the gaps, receive guidance from mentors, and evaluate my current portfolio to help get job-ready. Now that I’ve graduated from the TripleTen Software Engineering boot camp several months ago, I can give my candid and full review of the program. It’s mostly positive feedback, but I want to be honest about sub-par and frustrating areas. I can’t compare this against any other boot camp, but if you are considering learning how to code, consider TripleTen. When enrolling in the program, I owned a creative studio and had already built several dozen client websites. I knew how to code, but clients don’t always want or need a hardcoded website, so I wasn’t utilizing everything I knew often enough to feel extremely comfortable with the information. As much as I knew, I also knew there was a lot to learn, and I wanted a boot camp to provide structure, fill in the gaps, and pick up React JS (which I had no experience with) along the way. The following aspects of TripleTen were very positive for me. \nThe structure provided by the TripleTen curriculum. I have always been a self-disciplined, independent learner, but there are way too many resources online when it comes to code. Without external guidance, I sometimes learned code to a certain unnecessary depth because I lacked the wisdom to know what was important and what was not important to learn. The boot camp was extremely helpful here. The provided structure kept me focused on a large goal without getting caught too much in the weeds. Although it’s self-paced to an extent, you are still expected to hit deadlines and communicate with the team if you are falling behind for any reason. \nThe interactive platform was a plus. If you’ve ever utilized tools like Free Code Camp, you’re familiar with the idea of an interactive online platform. That’s all I expected from TripleTen, but they went well beyond my expectations. The UX and UI were excellent, and they did a great job throughout the sections, requiring the online platform to have a sense of humor and keep you moving through the segments. It all felt very polished, and you can tell they really thought this through. \nThe content taught in the course. The material was well thought out and well knit together. It felt cohesive, engaging, and well-explained. They utilized various resources (videos, PDFs, lecture notes, etc.) to help you understand each concept from multiple angles. This is important to note because not everyone learns the same way, so you can feel confident that they’ve anticipated that and developed a resource that will help you understand it well. \nThe instructors and course managers really care about you. As you go through the course, you will get a really good sense that everyone is there to help you succeed. It is not in anyone’s best interest to push you so far out of your comfort zone that you fail. I continually felt that they cared about what I was learning and why I was motivated to strengthen my knowledge of code. I have always felt this with code, and TripleTen further confirmed that programming is not a zero-sum field but a continually evolving and supporting discipline. \nThe following aspects of TripleTen could be improved upon. These are minor and just my experience, but I distrust reviews that are 100% flawless. \nThey requested you to review them too frequently. I understand the need for internal feedback on the lectures to allow them to iterate and improve quickly. That made sense to me. But very early in the course, they began asking you to recommend them online to your network and bring them referrals. While important for their business model, it felt like I was asked way too frequently, and I knew that I couldn’t honestly give my network a recommendation until after the course was over. \nThey don’t always make their calendar appointments. The first time was with my career advisor, and the other two times were office hours with the tutors. This is a part of life, and when it happened, they were apologetic. So why bring it up? It’s understandable if you’re notified in advance or shortly into a meeting that the individual cannot make the appointment. All three times, it was a “no-show,” and I only found something out hours later or the following day. I know these are isolated cases, but TripleTen students will often have a lot of other commitments in addition to their coursework, and rescheduling isn’t always possible. \nOffice hours are mostly great, but they can get chaotic. I have literally no idea how this could be improved, but when the instructors have an open time slot, you have no idea if you’ll be one of three students in there or one of ten. When too many students join a given office hour time slot, it compresses the time available to each student to ask their questions and work out a solution. In the later levels, when I most needed help from tutors, the office hours were the most chaotic. While the instructor wanted to help everyone, they just couldn’t, and we were told twice to find another time. If there was a way to RSVP for time slots or if more tutors were available for the harder sections, that could have helped. \nI had a great experience with TripleTen and am comfortable recommending them to anyone. They do a great job throughout the course, providing structure and helping every student, as best they can, to understand the material and succeed. My negative experiences were minimal and could have been because they were rebranding and switching systems (slack to discord) at the time. I would recommend you consider them if you’re looking for a boot camp!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Timothy Chan&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709150400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129362394?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67354#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Last year, right before I had found out about TripleTen, I had just been discharged from a behavioral health hospital. My mental state was stable but still poor due to many changes happening in my life. I was constantly moving from house to house, dropped out of my computer science college, and my part-time job that I somehow still had wasn’t any better. I didn’t know if I wanted to keep looking for a full-time job or pursue an education again. That was when my mom had recommended TripleTen (formally known as Practicum) to try out. One of her coworkers had told her about it and that it is a very flexible online programming bootcamp that they are able to work on while also having a part-time job. I was reluctant to pay more money that I didn’t have much of for another online bootcamp, but I decided to give it a shot.Immediately, I found a home at TripleTen. There is a community of tutors, peers, and other staff that are almost always online to help with questions. There are no strict times for lessons, instead I am able to work on their interactive platform any time I am off work. I love that the projects are organized into sprints and preparing us for actual real job experiences. Working and learning online can be difficult and discouraging, but keeping up with peers in office hours kept my motivation up and running. I fully recommend TripleTen to friends and family alike!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;ARTURO J ELIGIO&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709236800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67375#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Early 2023 i had decided i wanted to pursue Jobs in the tech industry specifically software Engineering so i had started looking into education this way i could pursue this goal of mine. I spent a few months doing my research on all types of education until i found TripleTen. I started reading reviews from graduates and quickly learned that all types of people from a wide range of industries and even across the world people had nothing, but amazing things to say about the boot camp. It didn&#39;t stop there i absolutely loved the fact that they believed in the course so deeply that If it takes longer than 6 months to get the job you trained for, they will refund 100% of your tuition on top of that the high 87% of graduates get hired in 6 month or less. I was sold and within a few days i applied with the boot camp and i had a 1 on 1 phone call with an admissions advisor and BOOM i was enrolled and thus my journey into the techfield began.It was daunting at first, but as i eased in to a program while working a full time job i quickly began my study routine which consisted of 4 hours on the weekdays and i like taking the weekends off (with some light studying and re-reviewing theory on the platform). The first 1-3 sprints the online platform is very interactive and i enjoy a lot of the work task within the theory of the sprints it&#39;s interactive and extremely informative, but the best part is if you have any questions or you don&#39;t feel confident in the theory theres always a tutor or even fellow senior students that are willing to help or clear things up for you. From time to time i like to part take when time allows in the group study sessions it&#39;s a great environment when you have people with common goals which usually consist of 20 minutes of studying and 10 minutes of a short break it creates a nice work flow.  I am currently in my 8th sprint learning the principles and application of OOP and oh boy is it difficult, but never fear community tutor hours are here! The community tutor hours consist of multiple students in a call and a community effort to help each other out on a issue your having. Although this current sprint im on is difficult i know theres somebody inside the community wether it&#39;s a tutor/senior student that can clear up any questions or issues i may have. My journey into tech is still beginning and i&#39;m here to see it all the way through and i can&#39;t wait to keep learning and being involved in this awesome community.TripleTen not only teaches you the technical skills that are required to get inside the tech field, but also the soft skills within the sprints theres always a chapter within the theory that has nuggets of wisdom. They can range from interview skills, networking, resume/ CV advice i always make sure to review these little nuggets every once in a while so i can impliment them once i become job ready which is coming up soon! If theres any advice that i could give to anyone that wants to start the Software Engineering course is that take it slow and easy, don&#39;t get discouraged when it comes to making errors. They will help you learn in the long term so just keep pushing!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Jadyn Wilson&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709236800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117223054?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67394#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I began looking into TripleTen in August of 2023. The first thing that really hooked me to this program was that a real person called me to talk about the program. It made TripleTen really stand out to me compared to other bootcamps I looked into. I also really liked how TripleTen includes career programs, because that was one of the biggest things I was worried about with starting this career path. While you are working on the sprints, there are chapters specifically made to help you succeed outside of the program. For Example, one chapter was just a guide on how to set up your LinkedIn profile to get more attention and be seen by more recruiters. They also give you tips on interviews, how to work as a good team member, and many more topics like this that I feel that I wouldn&#39;t have gotten through other bootcamps. One of the biggest things I have learned through TripleTen is its not easy. Your going to have hard times and you&#39;re going to get stuck somewhere, but I have never felt alone during the whole process. The tutors and success mangers are always checking up on you and are always there when you need some help, they are amazing! I am very happy with the decision I made to get an education through TripleTen!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Angel Baez&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709755200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67537#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;After studying medicine a couple of years in my home country I realized that I was a more creative kind of a person when it came to learning. So I switched careers and joined the software path I wanted. Although I joined the career I wanted, I felt that I wasn&#39;t in a continuous path of learning, there was nothing concrete nor continuity on any technology I was learning. While pursuing my associate&#39;s degree in software I tried different bootcamps from different platforms to experience what I really liked, until I found out that I loved web development. But again, didn&#39;t finish the course.Tripleten was the final tool that allowed me to become a software engineer. I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you&#39;re trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I&#39;ve done in my life.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Anonymous&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1709755200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67543#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career. Currently on Sprint 9 of 16, the journey has been tough yet fulfilling. Overall, TripleTen impresses with its supportive community, responsive tutors, and comprehensive curriculum, starting with basics like HTML/CSS and advancing to JavaScript. They stress perseverance and provide real-world insights. Teaching methods blend reading, videos, and interactive lessons, while pacing is rigorous but adaptable to student needs. Real-world projects enrich learning and build portfolios, with practical job application tips provided. The vibrant community, led by individuals like Dina, Max, and Kevin, keeps motivation high. My experience with TripleTen, particularly with Dina, Max, and Kevin, has been overwhelmingly positive, leading me to wholeheartedly recommend it to coding enthusiasts of all levels. TripleTen offers a challenging yet rewarding journey, promising similar experiences to future enrollees.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Pinar Gulum&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710100800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67593#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I possess two decades of experience in the hospitality industry, having worked in both restaurants and hotels. However, in 2023, I felt the need for a change and began exploring alternative career paths. After careful consideration, I realized that coding could be an excellent choice for my future.Despite being 42 years old, I decided to embrace this new challenge. My search for the best coding school led me to TripleTen, an online bootcamp. Since joining in March 2023, my journey has been nothing short of remarkable. The support I receive from the TripleTen team has been invaluable.Coding can be daunting, but the TripleTen team makes it significantly more manageable. Their round-the-clock availability of tutors aligns perfectly with my schedule, and their responsiveness is commendable. Whenever I need assistance, they promptly address my queries.I wholeheartedly recommend TripleTen to anyone interested in learning coding. This experience has enriched my knowledge base significantly, and I am proud of the substantial progress I’ve made in understanding this intricate field.Thank you, TripleTen, for this incredible journey!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Claudia Gracia Licor&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710705600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132604059?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67771#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I became interested in coding and software engineering about a year ago, shortly after I found TripleTen. I booked a call and got to learn a lot about it, and I knew I had made the right choice. I started in TripleTen in mid October of last year and in the short time I&#39;ve been a student I learned so much. I didn&#39;t just learn how to code but I learned time management, life balance, how to prioritize what&#39;s most important, and most importantly how to take care of myself and what matters to me. During my time at TripleTen I&#39;ve unfortunately been sick a couple times in which the TripleTen team was extremely understanding and organized extensions and encouraged me to take time off if I ever needed it. The community is amazing, caring, and understanding. Success Managers, Tutors and other students are always ready to lend a hand whenever you need it. TripleTen is the right choice if you&#39;re looking for a place to embrace learning and learn from the very best. You get advice from real software engineers who will give you tips to pass your code reviews, while teaching you the best practices and making sure that you understand where the information comes from.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michaela Budde&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1710964800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67843#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I don&#39;t think I could have found a more effective and affordable program than TripleTen. I left the education field for software engineering and needed a program that would be fairly fast, thorough and affordable. I found all of those things in their SE program. Not including the time I took off, it took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it&#39;s been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Sheena Irvin&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1711137600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,4],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67916#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I had a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen&#39;s features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined. Be sure that this is something you’d be passionate about- bc it won’t be easy. You will always be learning and will be challenged. This idea excites me, so if it doesn’t excite you- really think about what you want to do. They do offer other bootcamps as well for data analytics, data science, and QA&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39201312?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kevin Wessa</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>There are a lot of reasons to consider boot camps. For some, they see the potential of the industry and are looking for a career change. Others are self-taught programmers but want a boot camp to fill the gaps left by YouTube. I fell into the latter camp and was looking for a structured boot camp to... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> help fill in the gaps, receive guidance from mentors, and evaluate my current portfolio to help get job-ready. Now that I’ve graduated from the TripleTen Software Engineering boot camp several months ago, I can give my candid and full review of the program. It’s mostly positive feedback, but I want to be honest about sub-par and frustrating areas. I can’t compare this against any other boot camp, but if you are considering learning how to code, consider TripleTen. When enrolling in the program, I owned a creative studio and had already built several dozen client websites. I knew how to code, but clients don’t always want or need a hardcoded website, so I wasn’t utilizing everything I knew often enough to feel extremely comfortable with the information. As much as I knew, I also knew there was a lot to learn, and I wanted a boot camp to provide structure, fill in the gaps, and pick up React JS (which I had no experience with) along the way. The following aspects of TripleTen were very positive for me. 
The structure provided by the TripleTen curriculum. I have always been a self-disciplined, independent learner, but there are way too many resources online when it comes to code. Without external guidance, I sometimes learned code to a certain unnecessary depth because I lacked the wisdom to know what was important and what was not important to learn. The boot camp was extremely helpful here. The provided structure kept me focused on a large goal without getting caught too much in the weeds. Although it’s self-paced to an extent, you are still expected to hit deadlines and communicate with the team if you are falling behind for any reason. 
The interactive platform was a plus. If you’ve ever utilized tools like Free Code Camp, you’re familiar with the idea of an interactive online platform. That’s all I expected from TripleTen, but they went well beyond my expectations. The UX and UI were excellent, and they did a great job throughout the sections, requiring the online platform to have a sense of humor and keep you moving through the segments. It all felt very polished, and you can tell they really thought this through. 
The content taught in the course. The material was well thought out and well knit together. It felt cohesive, engaging, and well-explained. They utilized various resources (videos, PDFs, lecture notes, etc.) to help you understand each concept from multiple angles. This is important to note because not everyone learns the same way, so you can feel confident that they’ve anticipated that and developed a resource that will help you understand it well. 
The instructors and course managers really care about you. As you go through the course, you will get a really good sense that everyone is there to help you succeed. It is not in anyone’s best interest to push you so far out of your comfort zone that you fail. I continually felt that they cared about what I was learning and why I was motivated to strengthen my knowledge of code. I have always felt this with code, and TripleTen further confirmed that programming is not a zero-sum field but a continually evolving and supporting discipline. 
The following aspects of TripleTen could be improved upon. These are minor and just my experience, but I distrust reviews that are 100% flawless. 
They requested you to review them too frequently. I understand the need for internal feedback on the lectures to allow them to iterate and improve quickly. That made sense to me. But very early in the course, they began asking you to recommend them online to your network and bring them referrals. While important for their business model, it felt like I was asked way too frequently, and I knew that I couldn’t honestly give my network a recommendation until after the course was over. 
They don’t always make their calendar appointments. The first time was with my career advisor, and the other two times were office hours with the tutors. This is a part of life, and when it happened, they were apologetic. So why bring it up? It’s understandable if you’re notified in advance or shortly into a meeting that the individual cannot make the appointment. All three times, it was a “no-show,” and I only found something out hours later or the following day. I know these are isolated cases, but TripleTen students will often have a lot of other commitments in addition to their coursework, and rescheduling isn’t always possible. 
Office hours are mostly great, but they can get chaotic. I have literally no idea how this could be improved, but when the instructors have an open time slot, you have no idea if you’ll be one of three students in there or one of ten. When too many students join a given office hour time slot, it compresses the time available to each student to ask their questions and work out a solution. In the later levels, when I most needed help from tutors, the office hours were the most chaotic. While the instructor wanted to help everyone, they just couldn’t, and we were told twice to find another time. If there was a way to RSVP for time slots or if more tutors were available for the harder sections, that could have helped. 
I had a great experience with TripleTen and am comfortable recommending them to anyone. They do a great job throughout the course, providing structure and helping every student, as best they can, to understand the material and succeed. My negative experiences were minimal and could have been because they were rebranding and switching systems (slack to discord) at the time. I would recommend you consider them if you’re looking for a boot camp! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67355#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129362394?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Timothy Chan</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Last year, right before I had found out about TripleTen, I had just been discharged from a behavioral health hospital.

I didn’t know if I wanted to keep looking for a full-time job or pursue an education again. That was when my mom had recommended TripleTen (formally known as Practicum) to try out. One of her coworkers had told her about it and that it is a very flexible online programming bootcamp that they are able to work on while also having a part-time job. I was reluctant to pay more money that I didn’t have much of for another online bootcamp, but I decided to give it a shot.Immediately, I found a home at TripleTen. There is a community of tutors, peers, and other staff that are almost always online to help with questions. There are no strict times for lessons, instead I am able to work on their interactive platform any time I am off work. I love that the projects are organized into sprints and preparing us for actual real job experiences. Working and learning online can be difficult and discouraging, but keeping up with peers in office hours kept my motivation up and running.

I spent a few months doing my research on all types of education until i found TripleTen. I started reading revie... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ws from graduates and quickly learned that all types of people from a wide range of industries and even across the world people had nothing, but amazing things to say about the boot camp. It didn&#39;t stop there i absolutely loved the fact that they believed in the course so deeply that If it takes longer than 6 months to get the job you trained for, they will refund 100% of your tuition on top of that the high 87% of graduates get hired in 6 month or less. I was sold and within a few days i applied with the boot camp and i had a 1 on 1 phone call with an admissions advisor and BOOM i was enrolled and thus my journey into the techfield began.It was daunting at first, but as i eased in to a program while working a full time job i quickly began my study routine which consisted of 4 hours on the weekdays and i like taking the weekends off (with some light studying and re-reviewing theory on the platform). The first 1-3 sprints the online platform is very interactive and i enjoy a lot of the work task within the theory of the sprints it&#39;s interactive and extremely informative, but the best part is if you have any questions or you don&#39;t feel confident in the theory theres always a tutor or even fellow senior students that are willing to help or clear things up for you. From time to time i like to part take when time allows in the group study sessions it&#39;s a great environment when you have people with common goals which usually consist of 20 minutes of studying and 10 minutes of a short break it creates a nice work flow.  I am currently in my 8th sprint learning the principles and application of OOP and oh boy is it difficult, but never fear community tutor hours are here! The community tutor hours consist of multiple students in a call and a community effort to help each other out on a issue your having. Although this current sprint im on is difficult i know theres somebody inside the community wether it&#39;s a tutor/senior student that can clear up any questions or issues i may have. My journey into tech is still beginning and i&#39;m here to see it all the way through and i can&#39;t wait to keep learning and being involved in this awesome community.TripleTen not only teaches you the technical skills that are required to get inside the tech field, but also the soft skills within the sprints theres always a chapter within the theory that has nuggets of wisdom. They can range from interview skills, networking, resume/ CV advice i always make sure to review these little nuggets every once in a while so i can impliment them once i become job ready which is coming up soon! If theres any advice that i could give to anyone that wants to start the Software Engineering course is that take it slow and easy, don&#39;t get discouraged when it comes to making errors.

I also really liked how TripleTen includes career pr... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>ograms, because that was one of the biggest things I was worried about with starting this career path. While you are working on the sprints, there are chapters specifically made to help you succeed outside of the program. For Example, one chapter was just a guide on how to set up your LinkedIn profile to get more attention and be seen by more recruiters. They also give you tips on interviews, how to work as a good team member, and many more topics like this that I feel that I wouldn&#39;t have gotten through other bootcamps. One of the biggest things I have learned through TripleTen is its not easy. Your going to have hard times and you&#39;re going to get stuck somewhere, but I have never felt alone during the whole process. The tutors and success mangers are always checking up on you and are always there when you need some help, they are amazing!

I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you&#39;re trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I&#39;ve done in my life. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67537#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anonymous</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career.

I started in TripleTen in mid October of last year and in the short time I&#39;ve been a student I learned so... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> much. I didn&#39;t just learn how to code but I learned time management, life balance, how to prioritize what&#39;s most important, and most importantly how to take care of myself and what matters to me. During my time at TripleTen I&#39;ve unfortunately been sick a couple times in which the TripleTen team was extremely understanding and organized extensions and encouraged me to take time off if I ever needed it. The community is amazing, caring, and understanding. Success Managers, Tutors and other students are always ready to lend a hand whenever you need it. TripleTen is the right choice if you&#39;re looking for a place to embrace learning and learn from the very best. You get advice from real software engineers who will give you tips to pass your code reviews, while teaching you the best practices and making sure that you understand where the information comes from. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67771#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Michaela Budde</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I don&#39;t think I could have found a more effective and affordable program than TripleTen.

Not including the time I took off, it... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d> took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it&#39;s been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=67843#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Sheena Irvin</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><img src="../../star-empty.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I ha... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>d a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen&#39;s features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined. Be sure that this is something you’d be passionate about- bc it won’t be easy. You will always be learning and will be challenged. This idea excites me, so if it doesn’t excite you- really think about what you want to do.

For some, they see the potential of the industry and are looking for a career change. Others are self-taught programmers but want a boot camp to fill the gaps left by YouTube. I fell into the latter camp and was looking for a structured boot camp to help fill in the gaps, receive guidance from mentors, and evaluate my current portfolio to help get job-ready. Now that I’ve graduated from the TripleTen Software Engineering boot camp several months ago, I can give my candid and full review of the program. It’s mostly positive feedback, but I want to be honest about sub-par and frustrating areas. I can’t compare this against any other boot camp, but if you are considering learning how to code, consider TripleTen. When enrolling in the program, I owned a creative studio and had already built several dozen client websites. I knew how to code, but clients don’t always want or need a hardcoded website, so I wasn’t utilizing everything I knew often enough to feel extremely comfortable with the information. As much as I knew, I also knew there was a lot to learn, and I wanted a boot camp to provide structure, fill in the gaps, and pick up React JS (which I had no experience with) along the way. The following aspects of TripleTen were very positive for me. \nThe structure provided by the TripleTen curriculum. I have always been a self-disciplined, independent learner, but there are way too many resources online when it comes to code. Without external guidance, I sometimes learned code to a certain unnecessary depth because I lacked the wisdom to know what was important and what was not important to learn. The boot camp was extremely helpful here. The provided structure kept me focused on a large goal without getting caught too much in the weeds. Although it’s self-paced to an extent, you are still expected to hit deadlines and communicate with the team if you are falling behind for any reason. \nThe interactive platform was a plus. If you’ve ever utilized tools like Free Code Camp, you’re familiar with the idea of an interactive online platform. That’s all I expected from TripleTen, but they went well beyond my expectations. The UX and UI were excellent, and they did a great job throughout the sections, requiring the online platform to have a sense of humor and keep you moving through the segments. It all felt very polished, and you can tell they really thought this through. \nThe content taught in the course. The material was well thought out and well knit together. It felt cohesive, engaging, and well-explained. They utilized various resources (videos, PDFs, lecture notes, etc.) to help you understand each concept from multiple angles. This is important to note because not everyone learns the same way, so you can feel confident that they’ve anticipated that and developed a resource that will help you understand it well. \nThe instructors and course managers really care about you. As you go through the course, you will get a really good sense that everyone is there to help you succeed. It is not in anyone’s best interest to push you so far out of your comfort zone that you fail. I continually felt that they cared about what I was learning and why I was motivated to strengthen my knowledge of code. I have always felt this with code, and TripleTen further confirmed that programming is not a zero-sum field but a continually evolving and supporting discipline. \nThe following aspects of TripleTen could be improved upon. These are minor and just my experience, but I distrust reviews that are 100% flawless. \nThey requested you to review them too frequently. I understand the need for internal feedback on the lectures to allow them to iterate and improve quickly. That made sense to me. But very early in the course, they began asking you to recommend them online to your network and bring them referrals. While important for their business model, it felt like I was asked way too frequently, and I knew that I couldn’t honestly give my network a recommendation until after the course was over. \nThey don’t always make their calendar appointments. The first time was with my career advisor, and the other two times were office hours with the tutors. This is a part of life, and when it happened, they were apologetic. So why bring it up? It’s understandable if you’re notified in advance or shortly into a meeting that the individual cannot make the appointment. All three times, it was a “no-show,” and I only found something out hours later or the following day. I know these are isolated cases, but TripleTen students will often have a lot of other commitments in addition to their coursework, and rescheduling isn’t always possible. \nOffice hours are mostly great, but they can get chaotic. I have literally no idea how this could be improved, but when the instructors have an open time slot, you have no idea if you’ll be one of three students in there or one of ten. When too many students join a given office hour time slot, it compresses the time available to each student to ask their questions and work out a solution. In the later levels, when I most needed help from tutors, the office hours were the most chaotic. While the instructor wanted to help everyone, they just couldn’t, and we were told twice to find another time. If there was a way to RSVP for time slots or if more tutors were available for the harder sections, that could have helped. \nI had a great experience with TripleTen and am comfortable recommending them to anyone. They do a great job throughout the course, providing structure and helping every student, as best they can, to understand the material and succeed. My negative experiences were minimal and could have been because they were rebranding and switching systems (slack to discord) at the time. I would recommend you consider them if you’re looking for a boot camp!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Wessa"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Last year, right before I had found out about TripleTen, I had just been discharged from a behavioral health hospital. My mental state was stable but still poor due to many changes happening in my life. I was constantly moving from house to house, dropped out of my computer science college, and my part-time job that I somehow still had wasn’t any better. I didn’t know if I wanted to keep looking for a full-time job or pursue an education again. That was when my mom had recommended TripleTen (formally known as Practicum) to try out. One of her coworkers had told her about it and that it is a very flexible online programming bootcamp that they are able to work on while also having a part-time job. I was reluctant to pay more money that I didn’t have much of for another online bootcamp, but I decided to give it a shot.Immediately, I found a home at TripleTen. There is a community of tutors, peers, and other staff that are almost always online to help with questions. There are no strict times for lessons, instead I am able to work on their interactive platform any time I am off work. I love that the projects are organized into sprints and preparing us for actual real job experiences. Working and learning online can be difficult and discouraging, but keeping up with peers in office hours kept my motivation up and running. I fully recommend TripleTen to friends and family alike!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Timothy Chan"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Early 2023 i had decided i wanted to pursue Jobs in the tech industry specifically software Engineering so i had started looking into education this way i could pursue this goal of mine. I spent a few months doing my research on all types of education until i found TripleTen. I started reading reviews from graduates and quickly learned that all types of people from a wide range of industries and even across the world people had nothing, but amazing things to say about the boot camp. It didn't stop there i absolutely loved the fact that they believed in the course so deeply that If it takes longer than 6 months to get the job you trained for, they will refund 100% of your tuition on top of that the high 87% of graduates get hired in 6 month or less. I was sold and within a few days i applied with the boot camp and i had a 1 on 1 phone call with an admissions advisor and BOOM i was enrolled and thus my journey into the techfield began.It was daunting at first, but as i eased in to a program while working a full time job i quickly began my study routine which consisted of 4 hours on the weekdays and i like taking the weekends off (with some light studying and re-reviewing theory on the platform). The first 1-3 sprints the online platform is very interactive and i enjoy a lot of the work task within the theory of the sprints it's interactive and extremely informative, but the best part is if you have any questions or you don't feel confident in the theory theres always a tutor or even fellow senior students that are willing to help or clear things up for you. From time to time i like to part take when time allows in the group study sessions it's a great environment when you have people with common goals which usually consist of 20 minutes of studying and 10 minutes of a short break it creates a nice work flow.  I am currently in my 8th sprint learning the principles and application of OOP and oh boy is it difficult, but never fear community tutor hours are here! The community tutor hours consist of multiple students in a call and a community effort to help each other out on a issue your having. Although this current sprint im on is difficult i know theres somebody inside the community wether it's a tutor/senior student that can clear up any questions or issues i may have. My journey into tech is still beginning and i'm here to see it all the way through and i can't wait to keep learning and being involved in this awesome community.TripleTen not only teaches you the technical skills that are required to get inside the tech field, but also the soft skills within the sprints theres always a chapter within the theory that has nuggets of wisdom. They can range from interview skills, networking, resume/ CV advice i always make sure to review these little nuggets every once in a while so i can impliment them once i become job ready which is coming up soon! If theres any advice that i could give to anyone that wants to start the Software Engineering course is that take it slow and easy, don't get discouraged when it comes to making errors. They will help you learn in the long term so just keep pushing!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ARTURO J ELIGIO"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-02-29T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I began looking into TripleTen in August of 2023. The first thing that really hooked me to this program was that a real person called me to talk about the program. It made TripleTen really stand out to me compared to other bootcamps I looked into. I also really liked how TripleTen includes career programs, because that was one of the biggest things I was worried about with starting this career path. While you are working on the sprints, there are chapters specifically made to help you succeed outside of the program. For Example, one chapter was just a guide on how to set up your LinkedIn profile to get more attention and be seen by more recruiters. They also give you tips on interviews, how to work as a good team member, and many more topics like this that I feel that I wouldn't have gotten through other bootcamps. One of the biggest things I have learned through TripleTen is its not easy. Your going to have hard times and you're going to get stuck somewhere, but I have never felt alone during the whole process. The tutors and success mangers are always checking up on you and are always there when you need some help, they are amazing!

So I switched careers and joined the software path I wanted. Although I joined the career I wanted, I felt that I wasn't in a continuous path of learning, there was nothing concrete nor continuity on any technology I was learning. While pursuing my associate's degree in software I tried different bootcamps from different platforms to experience what I really liked, until I found out that I loved web development. But again, didn't finish the course.Tripleten was the final tool that allowed me to become a software engineer. I can tell that the key difference was the way the course is structure, platform and community support. Instructors which you can ask any questions to, constant feedback from code reviewers and community managers checking upon your progress. The lessons are designed by people who has plenty of experience doing the same thing you're trying to learn, which means you gain the knowledge but also absorb the experience they share. The platform is really cool, since it has task in which you practice the lessons you fresh learned, also has code pieces as examples which let you get used to read code.And if you feeling inspired and doing something for yourself, you can participate in code jams and put to practice whatever you have learned so far.Enrolling in tripleten has been probably one of the best choices I've done in my life.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Angel Baez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-06T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I first learned about TripleTen coding bootcamp from a friend and Instagram, sparking my interest in a coding career.

I didn't just learn how to code but I learned time management, life balance, how to prioritize what's most important, and most importantly how to take care of myself and what matters to me. During my time at TripleTen I've unfortunately been sick a couple times in which the TripleTen team was extremely understanding and organized extensions and encouraged me to take time off if I ever needed it. The community is amazing, caring, and understanding. Success Managers, Tutors and other students are always ready to lend a hand whenever you need it.

I left the education field for software engineering and needed a program that would be fairly fast, thorough and affordable. I found all of those things in their SE program. Not including the time I took off, it took me about a year to finish. Just a bit over their projected 10 month timeline. It’s a really supportive community. Having access to zoom office hours and being able to ask tutors questions on discord is super helpful. Even my partner who is a ML/AI engineer of 5 years is impressed with the program and what they teach us. Don’t get me wrong, it is not easy. I hit several walls and felt discouraged at multiple points. That’s where the community comes in. I have connected with fellow students, my success manager is always kind and supportive. The tutors are always understanding and always encourage asking questions. I couldn’t have finished without their help.Even before you graduate you have access to 1-1 meetings with career advisors. They have many seminars and discussions around career advancement as well. Once you graduate then you officially enter their career acceleration program. I feel confident that they will help me be prepared to land a job. While I doubt it will come to this, I still feel reassured that I can get my money back if I haven’t landed something after 6 months in their career program. Overall it's been really empowering to go from knowing nothing of coding to now being eligible for full-stack software engineering roles. It’s clear that there will always be more learning in this field. Technologies, coding languages, and systems are always changing and improving. But I’m excited to keep learning. I have a great foundation and I’m ready to keep going.Through the program, I have learned to enjoy coding. The attention to detail and ability to be creative is super stimulating to me. The ability to build a website or app from scratch, has opened so many doors for me and I really appreciate TripleTen for upholding a quality that I think is hard to find in bootcamps.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michaela Budde"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-03-22T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Here’s a breakdown of my experience thus far, I’m on the last portion of the bootcamp and after this I’ll be taking advantage of their career acceleration program to help with landing a job in the field of study: ◦ why I decided to start learning Software Engineering: when the Pandemic happened I had a chance to really evaluate what I wanted to do, and made a choice. I’ve always been in sales and grew to hate it. I love building/creating things and this made sense for me. I’ve enjoyed the finished products of my code and the challenges and growth that come with it. ◦ why I chose TripleTen and how I study: I was deciding between this and 9 other bootcamps. I ultimately chose TripleTen because of student reviews, outlined structure, support system, career acceleration, online based, self paced- sorta, and cost. I work full time so I study in the evenings and weekends!◦ what TripleTen's features I like most of all: interactive platform, projects, learning team and community. It’s hard to pick just one, and it made me feel great about my bootcamp when another person I connected on LinkedIn mentioned they went through one and it didn’t provide projects to add to their portfolio and career program. You really get your moneys worth here. ◦ how TripleTen helped me in my coding journey: Its provided me knowledge and practice for my field. I can’t speak too much on the career acceleration and landing a job yet as I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’ve started networking but haven’t applied yet to jobs. (Working on my last big project of developing a full stack application) but just fyi they offer coding jams and externships! ◦ what useful tips and advice I can give to those who are just at the beginning of their coding journey: be patient, focused, and disciplined.
