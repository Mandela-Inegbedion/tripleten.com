Another big one was the externship they offer. I didn&#39;t see other bootcamps providing this valuable opportunity. I&#39;m still in the middle of the program but so far I can tell that I&#39;m very happy with my experience. The biggest shout out to success managers and tutors. Tutors are doing an amazing job over there and make sure you really understand things. You can book 1:1 in case you need some personalized help. I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that&#39;s how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven&#39;t started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I&#39;m impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part. All in all, I think it&#39;s a great program and the price is really good for all the things you&#39;re getting from it.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Manuel David Calderon Garcia&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718049600000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86031155?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69880#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I&#39;ve always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but was always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I&#39;m in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don&#39;t let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Shawn Dishman&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718136000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6669dd7d241bd98ffd5152fe/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What makes TripleTen so great? In my experience, TripleTen is more than just a coding bootcamp. It&#39;s a community where I receive one-on-one feedback and tutoring from professional software developers. They guide me on what I&#39;m doing right and where I can improve, all while keeping best practices in mind.Being surrounded by like-minded individuals makes it easy to form study groups, push each other to succeed, and share ways to learn and retain information. Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn&#39;t know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I&#39;m currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I&#39;ve learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let&#39;s talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don&#39;t have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you&#39;re considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose?&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Karinne Hannah&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1718827200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70135#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I got an advertisement for TripleTen on my computer at an opportune time in my life, I had just been fired from my job and I had no income I had just completed my UX Design course on Coursera but wasn&#39;t getting any interviews or phone calls based off of the portfolio I provided. When I got an ad for TripleTen&#39;s bootcamp I thought that I could beef up my software engineering skills and taken more seriously as a designer because with this bootcamp I could make a product start to finish from designing it to programming it to testing it (TripleTen giving me the skills to program). The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn&#39;t know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn&#39;t just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn&#39;t get with a normal bootcamp that doesn&#39;t have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It&#39;s a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There&#39;s a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you&#39;re new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one.

I entered with a desire to learn and left with the skills, confidence, and connections needed to launch a successful career in software engineering. I would highly recommend TripleTen to anyone looking to enter or advance in this field. This bootcamp truly deserves a perfect rating of 5 out of 5.If you&#39;re serious about becoming a software engineer and want a program that goes above and beyond, look no further than TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Bree Massingill&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719864000000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70411#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve been working unfulfilling and underpaid jobs for the past 16 years, but I wanted to make a change. One thing I&#39;ve learned in this course is that even though I don&#39;t have a college degree, I&#39;ll still be able to find a good job with a good salary. My best friend started the TripleTen software engineering course, and he only had good things to say, so I decided to give it a shot as well. They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There&#39;s also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It&#39;s broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there&#39;s actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn&#39;t going away any time soon.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Justice Joshua Caleb Cupples&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1719950400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160805779?v=4&amp;s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70427#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age. A friend of mine got me back into programming and I decided to try bootcamps because they are objectively better than colleges if you plan to pursue a career in software. When I found TripleTen I honestly didn&#39;t believe their claims of jobs, coaching, and real-world experience. But it looked promising enough. So, I did a TON of research and found out it was actually true and wasn&#39;t just lies like so many bootcamps out there. I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I&#39;ve tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier. All in all, I highly recommend TripleTen.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Ian Stuart&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1720036800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70471#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I took on the TripleTen bootcamp to learn what it meant to be a Software Engineer and explore a shift in my career path.

The tutors and guides really want you to succeed and make themselves available on a daily basis to answer questions, provide feedback, or really to help you in any way they can. The lesson plans are clearly defined and offer in depth practice for each language you&#39;ll be exposed to. The deadlines for finishing a Sprint (2 week lesson plan) are always clearly shown and your Success Manager will check in to be sure you&#39;re still on track to finishing and offer support if you need more time or have questions. All in all, I&#39;m really impressed by the coursework and am appreciative of the tutors for their help so far.

I owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated tutors and supportive success managers who played a pivotal role in guiding me through challenges and keeping me on track. Their unwavering assistance propelled me toward my goal, and I deeply value their kindness and expertise. With this certification in hand, I am eager to apply my newfound skills meaningfully in the field of web development.During my final sprint, which presented significant challenges, I often found myself at a crossroads unsure of the next steps. It was during this critical phase that Kevin Loughead stood out, dedicating ample time to help me navigate complexities. His guidance was instrumental in clarifying the parameters required for controllers and frontend integration. Moreover, Kevin&#39;s expertise extended to refactoring backend models, streamlining data accessibility.One standout experience was working together on an application utilizing OpenAI&#39;s API. Kevin not only taught me how to effectively manipulate objects and arrays within my frontend functions but also collaborated on enhancing backend models for easier data retrieval. This personalized support was invaluable, highlighting TripleTen&#39;s commitment to nurturing practical skills and ensuring success in real-world applications.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}]]],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;],&quot;data-astro-cid-mp73v32e&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;VReviewsBlock&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div class="reviews-content" data-astro-cid-mp73v32e="true" data-v-d0c8d2b1><div class="reviews-list" client:load data-v-d0c8d2b1 data-v-fddf6a55><!--[--><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/666221cb73fcffaf62e2c2de/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Anna Vasileva</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I chose TripleTen because I could study part-time as I&#39;m having a full-time job which was one of the crucial points for me.

I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that&#39;s how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven&#39;t started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I&#39;m impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part. All in all, I think it&#39;s a great program and the price is really good for all the things you&#39;re getting from it. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86031155?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Manuel David Calderon Garcia</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I&#39;ve always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but wa... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>s always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I&#39;m in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don&#39;t let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=69880#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/6669dd7d241bd98ffd5152fe/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Shawn Dishman</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>What makes TripleTen so great?

Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn&#39;t know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I&#39;m currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I&#39;ve learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let&#39;s talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don&#39;t have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you&#39;re considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose? </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Karinne Hannah</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I got an advertisement for TripleTen on my computer at an opportune time in my life, I had just been fired from my job and I had no income I had just completed my UX Design course on Coursera but wasn&#39;t getting any interviews or phone calls based off of the portfolio I provided.

The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn&#39;t know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn&#39;t just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn&#39;t get with a normal bootcamp that doesn&#39;t have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It&#39;s a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There&#39;s a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you&#39;re new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one.

They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There&#39;s also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It&#39;s broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there&#39;s actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn&#39;t going away any time soon. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=70411#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160805779?v=4&amp;s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Justice Joshua Caleb Cupples</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I&#39;ve always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age.

So, I did a TON of research and found out it was actually true and wasn&#39;t just lies like so many bootcamps out there. I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I&#39;ve tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier.

Another big one was the externship they offer. I didn't see other bootcamps providing this valuable opportunity. I'm still in the middle of the program but so far I can tell that I'm very happy with my experience. The biggest shout out to success managers and tutors. Tutors are doing an amazing job over there and make sure you really understand things. You can book 1:1 in case you need some personalized help. I love the community: I made really good friends with some other students which really helps me be accountable. I think you can learn hard skills almost anywhere (online, youtube etc) but what makes the bootcamp special is all the support you get from people and that's how you stay motivated. Also have to mention their activities such Code Jams where you can unite with other students and work on a project together and then present it. Another big thing is a career support. I haven't started mu job search yet but already had a couple 1:1 with a career coach and I'm impressed by all the tools and knowledge they give you to succeed. The only thing that could be better is theory explanations. I wish they had more screencasts but as I know they are currently improving this part. All in all, I think it's a great program and the price is really good for all the things you're getting from it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anna Vasileva"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-10T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"QUICK BACKGROUND: I decided to pursue software engineering as my career in life while graduation was coming close, I had chosen software engineering since I've always liked Engineering as a whole and had fun learning math, and my background in tech was slightly better than any average person, but was always fascinated with new technology like phones, electric cars, robots, etc. especially now with the rise in technology, knowing how to program seems best convenient. I had started University in my native country, but once I moved to the US I had to drop out and start to work to help with my family, I still wanted to pursue my career in software so I was looking in every way possible and found Tripleten.Tripleten was one of the many boot camps I found, but what made it different from the rest at least for me was the guarantee of a Job after graduation and if not money return, especially in my case where the money had to be well spent and no time wasted Triplteten, at first sight, seemed the perfect fit, after the first few weeks I was able to implement my study time with work, tripleten has its course set so you can study on your time which helped a lot with my current job, I would spend around 20-30 hours of study every week. We communicate through Discord where we can find our tutor to help us with the projects, the projects are the most essential part of learning at least for me because I learn the most by doing, you can repeat concepts all you want but doing them is very different, and the projects are the base of all my knowledge of software engineering. The projects up until the sprint I'm in now, have mainly been about website building with HTML, CSS, and javascript, as of now I have way more grasp on what being a software engineer is and this Bootcamp has also helped me in vision my future personal projects even better now. My advice if you take Tripleten is to separate a good portion of your time in the week for the study time, organize your schedule, and don't let anything overwhelm you, your tutors are more than happy to help in Discord.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Manuel David Calderon Garcia"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-11T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"What makes TripleTen so great? In my experience, TripleTen is more than just a coding bootcamp. It's a community where I receive one-on-one feedback and tutoring from professional software developers. They guide me on what I'm doing right and where I can improve, all while keeping best practices in mind.Being surrounded by like-minded individuals makes it easy to form study groups, push each other to succeed, and share ways to learn and retain information. Before starting TripleTen, I was self-learning and thought I knew how to code. However, I quickly realized I didn't know as much as I thought, or at least not up to industry standards.I'm currently on sprint 12 out of 16, and I've learned so much since joining the program. This knowledge has helped me contribute to exciting projects and even create my own, like my video recording software built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program gave me the confidence to find and apply information, which is just as important as knowing how to write code. Understanding how it works and being able to read code allows you to find examples online and instantly know how to apply them. Professionals in the field will tell you that finding and applying information is crucial.Now, let's talk about another fantastic aspect of TripleTen: the career acceleration program. The job market can be intimidating, but with TripleTen, you don't have to face it alone. Career coaches dedicate their time to ensuring your success. They provide tips on writing your resume, creating a LinkedIn profile, effective networking, mock interviewing, and skill assessment testing—everything you need for real-world job interviews.If you're considering a switch to software engineering and want structured learning alongside others, I see no better option. They even offer a money-back guarantee if you don't get a job within six months after graduating and provide a free demo for a certain period. So, realistically, what do you have to lose?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shawn Dishman"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-06-19T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I got an advertisement for TripleTen on my computer at an opportune time in my life, I had just been fired from my job and I had no income I had just completed my UX Design course on Coursera but wasn't getting any interviews or phone calls based off of the portfolio I provided. When I got an ad for TripleTen's bootcamp I thought that I could beef up my software engineering skills and taken more seriously as a designer because with this bootcamp I could make a product start to finish from designing it to programming it to testing it (TripleTen giving me the skills to program). The bootcamp offers a software engineering course and flexible payment options to where I and others could pay what was possible, or defer our payments to the end of the program. This was perfect for my situation, and I am grateful to TripleTen for giving me an opportunity like this when I didn't know what to do next. Although I struggle with the curriculum as it is very different than me learning front end engineering in the past, I can get ample help through many different means through 1-1 tutor sessions, public tutor office hours, a question channel for the sprint I am working on, and coworking sessions with other students. I never really feel truly stuck because I use all of the resources available to me. When I have mental health concerns my success manager Daria helps me out and gets me through my current mental block so I can continue my work. I really feel like I have a friend to help me that isn't just my success manager but someone that actually cares about my wellbeing and not just my school performance which is invaluable and you wouldn't get with a normal bootcamp that doesn't have this support. The website, and the way the curriculum is structured needs work but TripleTen is constantly improving the website and listening to the complaints and concerns of students, this is why I gave the curriculum three stars I feel like the curriculum itself can be improved but I am not sure how. The instructors are helpful, but I struggle in code review. I love that after each project your sprints get reviewed by an actual person but the reviewers can be vague which makes review take longer, and when you are going through multiple iterations of  reviews that take several hours I have had to extend my deadline a few times, this is why I gave the instructors a four star because of the reviewers. The job assistance program is really something that shines in this program, and is different than everything I have experienced with other schools. TripleTen guarantees employment, or they will refund your tuition and they boast an over 80% success rate. There are career talks and tips that the career managers give that will help you with your resume and you get to talk to other alumni. In the end, I also want to highlight the ambassadorship program which you might not know about. I became an ambassador to be a representative for women in tech and help people that were in situations similar to me. In the ambassadorship, you get to create content that you like with some guidelines of content that you could do. All for the benefit of getting people into tech, how cool is that? I like the ambassadorship because I get to mingle with ambassadors from other programs and collaborate with them. It's a great way to make connections with people in other programs and your own. There's a lot of support from the ambassadors themselves and the success managers that help run the program so even if you're new to social media it is not that difficult to start. I believe I have covered everything that I can about this bootcamp and I hope that this review would be of help to anyone considering TripleTen or looking into tech bootcamps for a loved one.

One thing I've learned in this course is that even though I don't have a college degree, I'll still be able to find a good job with a good salary. My best friend started the TripleTen software engineering course, and he only had good things to say, so I decided to give it a shot as well. They have different payment options available, so you can choose what works for you (my friend is doing monthly installments, while I paid upfront). In all honesty, it has really exceeded my expectations! The content is very thorough, and I feel comfortable with how everything is presented. There's also a tiny bit of humor that runs through the course, which I really like. It's broken up into a series of sprints, each containing chapters about increasingly complex topics, followed by a project at the end of each sprint. I was expecting to just learn some programming languages and a lot of syntax, but there's actually a lot of math involved too. If you like playing with numbers, then you shouldn't have too much trouble. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who feels like their career has stagnated or is looking for something more secure, since tech isn't going away any time soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bree Massingill"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-07-02T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I've always been fascinated by computers and technology and really wanted to get into programming from a young age.

When I found TripleTen I honestly didn't believe their claims of jobs, coaching, and real-world experience. But it looked promising enough. So, I did a TON of research and found out it was actually true and wasn't just lies like so many bootcamps out there. I have been attending since early January and I am currently 72% done with the program as of early July. I've tried many different methods to learn coding in the past, but TripleTen is the only one that actually makes learning comprehensible. They have a Discord with a lot of support and also tutors to help you when you get stuck. They have amazing payment options, they give you loads of information on job finding, they have mock interviews, an amazing support staff, and tell you how to prepare for technical interviews. The projects they provide help you learn loads of real-world skills, and to top it all off they have externships to make getting a job that much easier.

I owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated tutors and supportive success managers who played a pivotal role in guiding me through challenges and keeping me on track. Their unwavering assistance propelled me toward my goal, and I deeply value their kindness and expertise. With this certification in hand, I am eager to apply my newfound skills meaningfully in the field of web development.During my final sprint, which presented significant challenges, I often found myself at a crossroads unsure of the next steps. It was during this critical phase that Kevin Loughead stood out, dedicating ample time to help me navigate complexities. His guidance was instrumental in clarifying the parameters required for controllers and frontend integration.
