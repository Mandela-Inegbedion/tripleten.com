Chose Data Analytics for skill growth and potential career shift. It was challenging yet incredibly rewarding, teaching me the power of embracing mistakes as stepping stones. The program equipped me with a diverse set of technical skills, from Python and SQL to business analytics and more—essential in today&#39;s dynamic professional landscape. Now applying parts of my journey in a new job. Proud I didn&#39;t give up and want to say, go for it!

I did not come into this program as fresh as some people are due to me having an Associates in Computer Programming and currently working in a IT Support role but there were still some fun and challenging sections. What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;quality-assurance&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kelly Shreeve&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1703620800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user.png?s=96&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65781#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As a returning student transitioning into data science, there were five things that were important to me when choosing a bootcamp: 1) part-time, 2) completely online, 3) real-world project experience, 4) reasonable price, 5) stellar career services. If you’re looking for the same, you’re in the right place. As a data science graduate, I can confidently say TripleTen fulfills all five. If you’ve been doing your research, you already know that TripleTen has an online learning platform with coding practice built into the lessons, real-world project experience, and material that is organized into two-week ‘sprints.’ But does it work? Yes! TripleTen allows you to work through the material completely part time and at your own pace. There are no unnecessary deadlines or class lectures to attend. What sold me on TripleTen, were the 16 real-world projects. With each project, you are given a data set and a loose set of guidelines for the task. It is up to you to load the dataset, work through the problem, and write a final report. These projects mimic real-world scenarios and interview questions. On top of that, TripleTen is one of the most affordable bootcamps on the market. During career prep, career coaches review your LinkedIn, resume, and cover letter and offer feedback to make your documents stand out. Then in Career Acceleration you meet with a coach weekly to guide your job search strategy, keep you accountable in the application process, and practice interviews. One thing reviews don’t mention, is the lovely community created on Discord, with tutors, community guides, and peers. I expected a data science education, but I didn’t expect to walk away with a community of friends and support systems. This program was challenging, but it was also very rewarding. I was successful in the data science program partially because of a background in statistics and coding. While surely anyone can do DS, some background in coding or statistics is useful. If you don’t have a background in either, consider an introductory course or two to make sure this path is the right one for you. If you’ve dabbled in statistics or coding and know you love it (or like it enough to make a career of it), then you’ll do great!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Course Report&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Raeann&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1703707200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I never thought I would be in a software engineering bootcamp but I am so glad I made that decision. As a preschool teacher, I wanted to learn more skills that might land me a higher-paying job. I came across TripleTen because my husband was in their Data Science bootcamp. He was telling me all about it and I just had to give it a try! The main selling point was their 100% money back guarantee if you don&#39;t get a job in that field within 6 months of graduating. I also had a 30% off coupon that helped tremendously when it came to funding! I have had the best time learning the ins and outs of software engineering. I&#39;ve had the most supportive team on Discord to connect with when I had any questions, joined office hours for more help, and a community manager that genuinely cared for me! I could not recommend TripleTen enough! I&#39;m so excited to get started on my full-stack software engineer journey in the tech world!&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Robert Morley&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1703707200000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65f06d706ad43d001149810c/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;m currently working on the Data Science Bootcamp from TripleTen and I love it so far. I&#39;m really satisfied with the support that they provide. They have tutors who can have 1-on-1 video calls with you to help you with any questions. I&#39;m not finished with the course yet but it&#39;s been a very positive experience. I would only recommend more video content in the course. Videos can often clear up confusion from reading text only. There is some video content but more would be very helpful. However, one of the great things about TripleTen is the career resources. They provide a course just for job searching that includes resume and portfolio help. Along with practice interviews. I definitely, recommend this TripleTen to anyone who is interested in a tech career. Their courses are in-depth and challenging which is exactly what you want when learning a new skill. The course is broken down into \&quot;sprints\&quot; that have a project at the end. The projects are great because they have people that review your work and give feedback and approve the project. When you&#39;re done you can add the projects to your portfolio for employers to see. Also, in the chapters of the sprint they give you tasks to solve a problem using the skills that you learned in the chapter. These are extremely helpful to me to reinforce what I&#39;ve learned.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Marin Umegane&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1703966400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/659197cfa6ef860012385a6a/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Transitioning careers without connections or knowledge, seeking remote opportunities due to commuting constraints, led me to TripleTen (formerly Practicum)—an ideal fit. Despite the name change adjustment, its structure and flexibility outweighed initial confusion.The split between self-paced learning and deadlines allowed flexible acceleration. Breaks between sprints and personal time eased the workload. I devoted 5-6 hours on weekdays and 2-3 on weekends, tailoring study to sprint demands and occasionally diving into extra research.Surprisingly, I didn&#39;t use office hours, preferring Discord for prompt queries. This nurtured self-research and honed question formulation—a boon for independent learners.TripleTen suits diverse learning styles, especially those inclined toward independent learning but needing occasional clarifications.While consulting professionals is invaluable, TripleTen empowers self-driven learners, navigating learning at their pace without hesitation.Novices in coding: Embrace self-learning with TripleTen&#39;s Discord support, flexible schedule, and project-oriented curriculum. Don&#39;t shy away from guidance—formulating questions is a learning curve.In conclusion, TripleTen&#39;s adaptable framework empowers self-directed learners, fostering a supportive community and practical skill development on their coding journey.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Marin Umegane&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1703966400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/tripleten&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I wanted to switch careers but didn&#39;t have many connections or a way to travel to a college. That&#39;s when I found TripleTen (formerly Practicum). The name change confused me a bit, but what mattered was its flexible way of teaching. They let me learn at my own pace and also gave me deadlines. This helped me manage my time. I studied 5-6 hours on weekdays and 2-3 hours on weekends. If I needed more understanding, I&#39;d spend extra time researching. Instead of attending scheduled sessions, I used Discord to ask questions. This way, I could learn on my own and only ask for help when needed. TripleTen is good for people like me who prefer learning independently but sometimes need a little extra explanation. Even though learning from professionals is helpful, TripleTen gave me the freedom to learn on my own without feeling embarrassed to ask for help. For beginners in coding: Use TripleTen&#39;s support on Discord, make your own schedule, and focus on projects. Don&#39;t hesitate to ask questions—learning to ask is part of the process. In short, TripleTen&#39;s way of teaching suits those who like to direct their own learning. It creates a helpful community and helps you build real coding skills.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;SwitchUp&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Dominic Martinez&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1704052800000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/65935c98514b8f0013b168e1/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My name is Dominic, I am in the Software Engineering course of TripleTen. The course is amazing and has taught me so much, I have never been tech savvy and TripleTen made it easy for me to learn so much about coding. The chapters and informative and user friendly. Some days it can seem overwhelming but there is a great community of tutors and community managers that are supportive and help with anything you are having an issue with. I will say if there is anything that will help you get what you need to get done for the course that you don&#39;t have i highly suggest investing in yourself and getting what you need. For myself I&#39;ve invested in a good mouse, a good set of headphones, and a lot of energy drinks. Also look into getting a good chair and if you can multiple screens I cannot stress enough that the more screen space you have the smoother time you will have. The most important investment is yourself, and TripleTen can help you succeed and have a career that you have always dreamed of, and if Software Engineering isnt for you they have so many other programs to choose from that will fit your style more, and with a strong community to help success is waiting for you.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Software Engineering&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;software-engineering&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Kristy Williams&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1704398400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6598c1c58d1a620011cc872f/73x73.png&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Enrolling in the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp has been an enriching journey, marked by two months of immersive learning experiences so far that promise to equip me with invaluable skills for the dynamic field of data science. I choose this program on the recommendation of some friends. I had previously been in tech over 20 years ago, but I felt it was time to jump back in and wanted to get back into a field that excited me. This an online program, spanning a comprehensive nine-month duration, promising to provide me with a structured and hands-on approach to mastering the intricacies of data science. The online nature of the boot camp ensures flexibility and accessibility, allowing participants to engage with the content from the comfort of their own space. A distinguishing feature of the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp is its emphasis on hands-on projects. These projects serve as practical applications of the theoretical concepts covered in the curriculum, providing an opportunity to work on real-world data sets and gain practical experience.&quot;],&quot;program&quot;:[0,&quot;Data Science&quot;],&quot;programs&quot;:[5,[[0,&quot;reviews&quot;],[0,&quot;data-science&quot;]]],&quot;siteName&quot;:[0,&quot;Trustpilot&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;name&quot;:[0,&quot;Michael Allen&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,1704398400000],&quot;stars&quot;:[0,5],&quot;profilePicture&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65907#reviews&quot;],&quot;useful&quot;:[0,0],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;I&#39;ve always been interested in tech, but never knew where to start. After doing research on different bootcamps, I decided to commit to TripleTen. I loved how they offered a platform with other students and tutors to help guide me on my journey of becoming a QA Engineer. They offer a ton of resources and real guidance on how to properly execute each sprint. I am currently a part-time student who works a full-time job. TripleTen does a great job with assisting students on sprints, projects, and honestly anything else you as a student may need! One of my favorite features of this bootcamp was the interactive platform, and Discord community. Being familiar with Discord helped me navigate each sprint along with correlating projects and any resources the tutors and students posted. Everyone in TripleTen is honestly so helpful and personable. I feel confident and comfortable with reaching out for help whenever it is needed. There&#39;s no better feeling than getting a project approved and continuing to learn. It has been an incredible journey thus far.

What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65705#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../s3.amazonaws.com/course_report_production/misc_imgs/default_user71f2.png?s=96" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kelly Shreeve</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>As a returning student transitioning into data science, there were five things that were important to me when choosing a bootcamp: 1) part-time, 2) completely online, 3) real-world project experience, 4) reasonable price, 5) stellar career services. If you’re looking for the same, you’re in the righ... </span><span class="text-hidden" data-v-b9cc090d>t place. As a data science graduate, I can confidently say TripleTen fulfills all five. If you’ve been doing your research, you already know that TripleTen has an online learning platform with coding practice built into the lessons, real-world project experience, and material that is organized into two-week ‘sprints.’ But does it work? Yes! TripleTen allows you to work through the material completely part time and at your own pace. There are no unnecessary deadlines or class lectures to attend. What sold me on TripleTen, were the 16 real-world projects. With each project, you are given a data set and a loose set of guidelines for the task. It is up to you to load the dataset, work through the problem, and write a final report. These projects mimic real-world scenarios and interview questions. On top of that, TripleTen is one of the most affordable bootcamps on the market. During career prep, career coaches review your LinkedIn, resume, and cover letter and offer feedback to make your documents stand out. Then in Career Acceleration you meet with a coach weekly to guide your job search strategy, keep you accountable in the application process, and practice interviews. One thing reviews don’t mention, is the lovely community created on Discord, with tutors, community guides, and peers. I expected a data science education, but I didn’t expect to walk away with a community of friends and support systems. This program was challenging, but it was also very rewarding. I was successful in the data science program partially because of a background in statistics and coding. While surely anyone can do DS, some background in coding or statistics is useful. If you don’t have a background in either, consider an introductory course or two to make sure this path is the right one for you. If you’ve dabbled in statistics or coding and know you love it (or like it enough to make a career of it), then you’ll do great! </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tripleten?shared_review=65781#reviews" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Course Report</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><svg class="user-avatar" width="56" height="56" viewBox="0 0 56 56" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-v-b9cc090d><rect width="56" height="56" rx="28" fill="#DFDEDB" data-v-b9cc090d></rect><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M28 30.35C24.75 30.35 23 27.1754 23 23.625C23 20.15 25 18 28 18C31 18 33 20.15 33 23.625C33 27.1754 31.25 30.35 28 30.35ZM28 28.35C29.7395 28.35 31 26.5013 31 23.625C31 21.2462 29.878 20 28 20C26.122 20 25 21.2462 25 23.625C25 26.5013 26.2606 28.35 28 28.35ZM20.9401 37.9982C21.4914 38.0313 21.9652 37.6112 21.9982 37.0599C22.1136 35.1378 24.0413 34 28.0038 34C31.9644 34 33.8868 35.1363 34.0035 37.0606C34.0369 37.6118 34.511 38.0316 35.0622 37.9982C35.6135 37.9647 36.0333 37.4907 35.9998 36.9394C35.8047 33.7224 32.8907 32 28.0038 32C23.1148 32 20.1948 33.7235 20.0018 36.9401C19.9687 37.4914 20.3888 37.9651 20.9401 37.9982Z" fill="black" fill-opacity="0.83" data-v-b9cc090d></path></svg><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Raeann</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>I never thought I would be in a software engineering bootcamp but I am so glad I made that decision.

Videos can often clear up confusion from reading text only. There is some video content but more would be very helpful. However, one of the great things about TripleTen is the career resources. They provide a course just for job searching that includes resume and portfolio help. Along with practice interviews. I definitely, recommend this TripleTen to anyone who is interested in a tech career. Their courses are in-depth and challenging which is exactly what you want when learning a new skill. The course is broken down into &quot;sprints&quot; that have a project at the end. The projects are great because they have people that review your work and give feedback and approve the project. When you&#39;re done you can add the projects to your portfolio for employers to see. Also, in the chapters of the sprint they give you tasks to solve a problem using the skills that you learned in the chapter. These are extremely helpful to me to reinforce what I&#39;ve learned. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/659197cfa6ef860012385a6a/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Marin Umegane</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Software Engineering</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Transitioning careers without connections or knowledge, seeking remote opportunities due to commuting constraints, led me to TripleTen (formerly Practicum)—an ideal fit.

Instead of attending scheduled sessions, I used Discord to ask questions. This way, I could learn on my own and only ask for help when needed. TripleTen is good for people like me who prefer learning independently but sometimes need a little extra explanation. Even though learning from professionals is helpful, TripleTen gave me the freedom to learn on my own without feeling embarrassed to ask for help. For beginners in coding: Use TripleTen&#39;s support on Discord, make your own schedule, and focus on projects. Don&#39;t hesitate to ask questions—learning to ask is part of the process.

For myself I&#39;ve invested in a good mouse, a good set of headphones, and a lot of energy drinks. Also look into getting a good chair and if you can multiple screens I cannot stress enough that the more screen space you have the smoother time you will have. The most important investment is yourself, and TripleTen can help you succeed and have a career that you have always dreamed of, and if Software Engineering isnt for you they have so many other programs to choose from that will fit your style more, and with a strong community to help success is waiting for you. </span><span data-v-b9cc090d><a href="#" data-v-b9cc090d>Read more</a></span></div><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tripleten.com" class="review-link" target="_blank" data-v-b9cc090d> Read review <span data-v-b9cc090d> on Trustpilot</span><img src="../link-icon.svg" alt="" data-v-b9cc090d></a><div class="border-line" data-v-b9cc090d></div></div><div class="review" data-v-fddf6a55 data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-info" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="review-user" data-v-b9cc090d><img class="user-avatar" src="../../../user-images.trustpilot.com/6598c1c58d1a620011cc872f/73x73.png" alt="User Avatar" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer" data-v-b9cc090d><div class="reviewer-name" data-v-b9cc090d>Kristy Williams</div><div class="reviewer-program" data-v-b9cc090d> Program: <span class="reviewer-program_black" data-v-b9cc090d>Data Science</span></div></div></div><div class="stars" data-v-b9cc090d><!--[--><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><img src="../star.svg" alt="Star" data-v-b9cc090d><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="review-text" data-v-b9cc090d><span class="text-visible" data-v-b9cc090d>Enrolling in the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp has been an enriching journey, marked by two months of immersive learning experiences so far that promise to equip me with invaluable skills for the dynamic field of data science.

One of my favorite features of this bootcamp was the interactive platform, and Discord community. Being familiar with Discord helped me navigate each sprint along with correlating projects and any resources the tutors and students posted. Everyone in TripleTen is honestly so helpful and personable. I feel confident and comfortable with reaching out for help whenever it is needed.

I did not come into this program as fresh as some people are due to me having an Associates in Computer Programming and currently working in a IT Support role but there were still some fun and challenging sections. What this bootcamp also did was help reignite my desire to really make this the career that I want to do for the rest of my life.  One of the best things about this program is the students. They are always there to help you answer any questions and it helps you feel part of a community when everyone works to help each other out.  TripleTen also helps you work on your time management skills as each project can be worked at your own pace, but you still have deadlines for each project. It not only provides you the tools needed to complete specific types of testing but they also provide the fundamentals of quality assurance and software testing.  By the end of the program, you can confidently say that you know how to perform manual testing, automatic testing, mobile testing, API testing and more. My favorite project was actually the API testing as I really found the Postman application fun to use and with my current background in IT support it helped me understand how certain things work with my companies proprietary software.  Also, once you complete the program they don’t just throw you out into the woods and wish you the best. They want you and me to succeed in this career, which is why they provide career coaching. I’m in the process of looking for my first job after completing the program and my career coach has been so beneficial in helping me improve my LinkedIn, resume and cover letter.  If you are wanting to find a way to change careers and work in tech I would recommend TripleTen. The students, senior students, and tutors are always there to help answer any questions that you have.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tyrus Skipper"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-26T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"As a returning student transitioning into data science, there were five things that were important to me when choosing a bootcamp: 1) part-time, 2) completely online, 3) real-world project experience, 4) reasonable price, 5) stellar career services. If you’re looking for the same, you’re in the right place. As a data science graduate, I can confidently say TripleTen fulfills all five. If you’ve been doing your research, you already know that TripleTen has an online learning platform with coding practice built into the lessons, real-world project experience, and material that is organized into two-week ‘sprints.’ But does it work? Yes! TripleTen allows you to work through the material completely part time and at your own pace. There are no unnecessary deadlines or class lectures to attend. What sold me on TripleTen, were the 16 real-world projects. With each project, you are given a data set and a loose set of guidelines for the task. It is up to you to load the dataset, work through the problem, and write a final report. These projects mimic real-world scenarios and interview questions. On top of that, TripleTen is one of the most affordable bootcamps on the market. During career prep, career coaches review your LinkedIn, resume, and cover letter and offer feedback to make your documents stand out. Then in Career Acceleration you meet with a coach weekly to guide your job search strategy, keep you accountable in the application process, and practice interviews. One thing reviews don’t mention, is the lovely community created on Discord, with tutors, community guides, and peers. I expected a data science education, but I didn’t expect to walk away with a community of friends and support systems. This program was challenging, but it was also very rewarding. I was successful in the data science program partially because of a background in statistics and coding. While surely anyone can do DS, some background in coding or statistics is useful. If you don’t have a background in either, consider an introductory course or two to make sure this path is the right one for you. If you’ve dabbled in statistics or coding and know you love it (or like it enough to make a career of it), then you’ll do great!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kelly Shreeve"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-27T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I never thought I would be in a software engineering bootcamp but I am so glad I made that decision. As a preschool teacher, I wanted to learn more skills that might land me a higher-paying job. I came across TripleTen because my husband was in their Data Science bootcamp. He was telling me all about it and I just had to give it a try! The main selling point was their 100% money back guarantee if you don't get a job in that field within 6 months of graduating. I also had a 30% off coupon that helped tremendously when it came to funding! I have had the best time learning the ins and outs of software engineering. I've had the most supportive team on Discord to connect with when I had any questions, joined office hours for more help, and a community manager that genuinely cared for me! I could not recommend TripleTen enough! I'm so excited to get started on my full-stack software engineer journey in the tech world!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Raeann"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-27T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"I'm currently working on the Data Science Bootcamp from TripleTen and I love it so far. I'm really satisfied with the support that they provide. They have tutors who can have 1-on-1 video calls with you to help you with any questions. I'm not finished with the course yet but it's been a very positive experience. I would only recommend more video content in the course. Videos can often clear up confusion from reading text only. There is some video content but more would be very helpful. However, one of the great things about TripleTen is the career resources. They provide a course just for job searching that includes resume and portfolio help. Along with practice interviews. I definitely, recommend this TripleTen to anyone who is interested in a tech career. Their courses are in-depth and challenging which is exactly what you want when learning a new skill. The course is broken down into \"sprints\" that have a project at the end. The projects are great because they have people that review your work and give feedback and approve the project. When you're done you can add the projects to your portfolio for employers to see. Also, in the chapters of the sprint they give you tasks to solve a problem using the skills that you learned in the chapter. These are extremely helpful to me to reinforce what I've learned.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Morley"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-30T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Transitioning careers without connections or knowledge, seeking remote opportunities due to commuting constraints, led me to TripleTen (formerly Practicum)—an ideal fit.

That's when I found TripleTen (formerly Practicum). The name change confused me a bit, but what mattered was its flexible way of teaching. They let me learn at my own pace and also gave me deadlines. This helped me manage my time. I studied 5-6 hours on weekdays and 2-3 hours on weekends. If I needed more understanding, I'd spend extra time researching. Instead of attending scheduled sessions, I used Discord to ask questions. This way, I could learn on my own and only ask for help when needed. TripleTen is good for people like me who prefer learning independently but sometimes need a little extra explanation. Even though learning from professionals is helpful, TripleTen gave me the freedom to learn on my own without feeling embarrassed to ask for help. For beginners in coding: Use TripleTen's support on Discord, make your own schedule, and focus on projects. Don't hesitate to ask questions—learning to ask is part of the process. In short, TripleTen's way of teaching suits those who like to direct their own learning. It creates a helpful community and helps you build real coding skills.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marin Umegane"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Software Engineering","description":"Join our part-time Software Engineering Bootcamp to earn ~$75,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P10M"}]},"datePublished":"2023-12-31T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"My name is Dominic, I am in the Software Engineering course of TripleTen. The course is amazing and has taught me so much, I have never been tech savvy and TripleTen made it easy for me to learn so much about coding. The chapters and informative and user friendly. Some days it can seem overwhelming but there is a great community of tutors and community managers that are supportive and help with anything you are having an issue with. I will say if there is anything that will help you get what you need to get done for the course that you don't have i highly suggest investing in yourself and getting what you need. For myself I've invested in a good mouse, a good set of headphones, and a lot of energy drinks. Also look into getting a good chair and if you can multiple screens I cannot stress enough that the more screen space you have the smoother time you will have. The most important investment is yourself, and TripleTen can help you succeed and have a career that you have always dreamed of, and if Software Engineering isnt for you they have so many other programs to choose from that will fit your style more, and with a strong community to help success is waiting for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dominic Martinez"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen"}},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Course","name":"Data Science","description":"Join our part-time Data Science Bootcamp to earn ~$89,000 remotely in your first job after graduation","provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TripleTen","url":"https://tripleten.com/"},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","category":"Paid"},"hasCourseInstance":[{"@type":"CourseInstance","courseMode":["Online"],"courseWorkload":"P8M"}]},"datePublished":"2024-01-04T20:00:00.000Z","reviewBody":"Enrolling in the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp has been an enriching journey, marked by two months of immersive learning experiences so far that promise to equip me with invaluable skills for the dynamic field of data science.

This an online program, spanning a comprehensive nine-month duration, promising to provide me with a structured and hands-on approach to mastering the intricacies of data science. The online nature of the boot camp ensures flexibility and accessibility, allowing participants to engage with the content from the comfort of their own space.

After doing research on different bootcamps, I decided to commit to TripleTen. I loved how they offered a platform with other students and tutors to help guide me on my journey of becoming a QA Engineer. They offer a ton of resources and real guidance on how to properly execute each sprint. I am currently a part-time student who works a full-time job. TripleTen does a great job with assisting students on sprints, projects, and honestly anything else you as a student may need! One of my favorite features of this bootcamp was the interactive platform, and Discord community. Being familiar with Discord helped me navigate each sprint along with correlating projects and any resources the tutors and students posted. Everyone in TripleTen is honestly so helpful and personable. I feel confident and comfortable with reaching out for help whenever it is needed. There's no better feeling than getting a project approved and continuing to learn. It has been an incredible journey thus far.
